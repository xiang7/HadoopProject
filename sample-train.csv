"1","How to check if an uploaded file is an image without mime type?","<p>I'd like to check if an uploaded file is an image file (e.g png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp) or another file. The problem is that I'm using Uploadify to upload the files, which changes the mime type and gives a 'text/octal' or something as the mime type, no matter which file type you upload.</p>

<p>Is there a way to check if the uploaded file is an image apart from checking the file extension using PHP?</p>

"2","How can I prevent firefox from closing when I press ctrl-w","<p>In my favorite editor (vim), I regularly use ctrl-w to execute a certain action. Now, it quite often happens to me that firefox is the active window (on windows) while I still look at vim (thinking vim is the active window) and press ctrl-w which closes firefox. This is not what I want. Is there a way to stop ctrl-w from closing firefox?</p>

I figure since the code already works for WP7, it should be a matter of mostly copying and pasting it for the C# code behind. </p>

I just need to figure out how to fetch the page, I assume the parsing will be the same as on my phone app. Any help?</p>

<p>Context: I'm creating some tree graph plotting software and testing it by using multi-digit random numbers (so each digit becomes a node in the tree). The random number generator I've been using - which is the one that comes with the GNU C++ compiler - gives me a nice spread of values. That's good, but I want to see how the table looks when the numbers clump together and are less homogenous. </p>

"16","PHP framework URL conventions","<p>A lot of frameworks use URL conventions like <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> which is great, but if you need any configuration beyond that, it's up to you to write your own routes.</p>

<p>How would you handle URLs like <code>/users/{id}/friends</code> on the backend? (to list all of a user's friends)</p>

<p>I'm thinking that in the controller, something like this would be appropriate:</p>

<pre><code>class User {
    function index() {
        echo 'user index';
    }
}

class Friend extends User {
    function index($user_id) {
        echo 'friend index';
    }    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would have the following map:</p>

<pre><code>/users              -&gt; User::index()
/users/{id}         -&gt; User::view($id)
/users/{id}/friends -&gt; Friend::index($user_id)
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to put the Friend class inside the User class but apparently you can't do that in PHP so this is the best I could come up with. Thoughts?</p>

<p>What URL would use for editing your list of friends? <code>/users/{id}/friends/edit</code> could work, but it doesn't seem appropriate, since you should never be editing someone else's friend list. Would <code>/account/friends/edit</code> be a better choice? Where would you put the corresponding code for that? In a friend controller, or a user controller, or a specialized account controller?</p>

<p>Bonus question: which do you prefer? <code>/photos/delete/{id}</code> or <code>/photos/{id}/delete</code></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>The answers:</strong></p>

<p>So, what I've gathered from the answers is that if the ""thing"" is complicated (like ""friends"") but doesn't have its own controller, you can give it one without a model, or if it's not, you should stuff it in with whatever it's most closely related to. Your URLs should not influence where you put your code. Most people seem to think you should stick to <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> whever possible, because it's what people are familiar with.</p>

<p>No one really commented on the extended class aside from saying it's ""awkward"". Perhaps FriendList would have been a more appropriate class in that case if I really wanted to separate it out.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the answers :)</p>

<hr>

<p>I ran across the movie <a href=""http://cutpoisonburn.com/"">Cut Poison Burn</a>, who's abstract is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cut Poison Burn is a controversial, eye opening, and sometimes heartbreaking documentary that puts the business of cancer treatment under the microscope. Follow the frustrating journeys of critically ill cancer patients as they try to navigate the confusing and dangerous maze of treatment and encounter formidable obstacles in the “cancer industrial complex.”  A compelling critique of the influence of medical monopolies, the power of pharmaceutical companies and government agencies, Cut Poison Burn is essential viewing for anyone and everyone touched by cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The movie may advocate (haven't watched the whole thing) some kind of new, pennies-per-session treatment a la <a href=""http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4611/does-burzynski-have-a-miracle-cancer-cure-being-suppressed-by-the-fda"">Burzynski</a>, or at least <a href=""http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/19/cut-poison-burn.aspx"">Dr. Mercola is using it to do so</a>.</p>

<p>There are a myriad of claims in the movie, I'm sure (I only watched the first 10min), but I'd like to address one in particular that struck me (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/26874089"">occurs starting at the 7min mark</a>). It is made by Charles B. Simone, M.MS, M.D., founder of the <a href=""http://www.drsimone.com/center.htm"">Simone Protective Cancer Center</a> (transcripted by me; may contain small errors):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From 1920 to the present time, we have made little or no progress in the treatment of adult cancers. So a person who gets prostate cancer or breast cancer today will live as long as a person who got it in 1920. No big change. With all the radiation therapy that began in the 10's and 20's, combination chemotherapy in the 60's, immunotherapy that began in the 70's, PET scans, MRI scans, you name it, billions and billions and billions of research dollar that we've thrown into this whole area of cancer research and treatment... little or no significant progress in the treatment of adult cancers.</p>

<p>Is this the case? Has no treatment since 1920 done anything to increase the chance of [long-term] survival of adults who have cancer?</p>

I'd like to know if this is the best approach.</p>

<p>Example enumeration:
<pre><code>[Flags]
enum Status {
  None = 0x0,
  Active = 0x1,
  Inactive = 0x2,
  Canceled = 0x4,
  Suspended = 0x8
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>The extension method that converts the set flags to array of int that I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>public static class Extensions
{
    public static int[] ToIntArray(this System.Enum o) 
    {
        return o.ToString()
            .Split(new string[] { "", "" }, StringSplitOptions.None)
            .Select(i => (int)Enum.Parse(o.GetType(), i))
            .ToArray();
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>This is how I use it:</p>

<pre><code>Status filterStatus = Status.Suspended | Status.Canceled;

int[] filterFlags = filterStatus.toIntArray();

foreach (int flag in filterFlags) {
   Console.WriteLine(""{0}\n"", flag);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will output:</p>

<pre><code>4
8</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, to get this done I'm doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Converting the variable to string. It outputs something like: Suspended, Canceled</li>
<li>Splitting that string into an array of strings: { ""Suspended"", ""Canceled"" }</li>
<li>Converting that string to the enumeration value with Enum.Parse.</li>
<li>Casting the value to an integer.</li>
<li>Converting the IEnumerable to int[].</li>
</ol>

<p>It works, but I just don't think it's the best approach. Any suggestions to improve this bit of code?</p>

The makefile contains the path to the compiler as well as the path to all the files that could possibly be used in the compiling operation. The MAKE application reads the makefile and combines the sources into 1 file which the compiler then reads and converts into the relevant assembly/machine code.</p>

<p>The #include directive is a directive that tells the make file to:
""include the contents of this file into this point of the larger file that you're making to feed to the compiler then resume with the current file"".</p>

<p>The MAKE application also tells the compiler where to ""emit"" the result of the compile operation once the compiling is completed. In this regard a Visual Studio .csproj file is technically a XML based makefile for a Microsoft specific MAKE application.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Except that I want to stick with MVC's own bundling if I can. I'm having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work.</p>

<p>I have a typical MVC site structure with <code>/Content/css/</code> which contains my base CSS such as <code>styles.css</code>. Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as <code>/jquery-ui</code> which contains its CSS file plus an <code>/images</code> folder. Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don't want to mess with them.</p>

<p>As I understand it, when I specify a <code>StyleBundle</code> I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path, because (assuming I'm ignoring routes to Content) IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file. So I'm specifying:</p>

<pre><code>bundles.Add( 
    new StyleBundle(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")
        .Include(""~/Content/css/jquery-ui/*.css""));
</code></pre>

<p>rendered using:</p>

<p><code>@Styles.Render(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")</code></p>

<p>I can see the request going out to:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/jquery-ui?v=nL_6HPFtzoqrts9nwrtjq0VQFYnhMjY5EopXsK8cxmg1</code></p>

<p>This is returning the correct minified CSS response. 
But then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_100_eeeeee_1x100.png</code></p>

<p>Which is a <code>404</code>.</p>

<p>I understand that the last part of my URL <code>jquery-ui</code> is an extensionless URL, a handler for my bundle, so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply <code>/styles/images/</code>. </p>

<p>So my question is <strong>what is the correct way</strong> of handling this situation? </p>

I'm already a month late on my mortgage and this really isn't helping my situation.  I've been working on fixing this intermittent load problem for months (never this bad). </p>

<p>I'm suspecting some kind of attack since I'm under DDOS attack a lot!  I've been trying to figure out what is causing the load but I'm afraid I just don't have the experience or knowledge to understand all the data I've been looking at.  I don't even know where to begin or how to test for the large array of attacks out there.</p>

<p>Here's some data you might find useful...</p>

<p>Server:  Xeon X3220 Quad Core 2.4 GHz - Linux, FreeBSD 500 GB HD and 8 Gig of Ram.  Runs Centos release 5.7

<p>Warning:  All sites are softcore adult sites - mostly fantasy art like elves and amazons.</p>

<p>1)  Sites may run fine for weeks or just days at less than 10 load then start jumping to 40-80 load - no idea why.  Same sites, same mods, same amount of traffic - just WHAM!</p>

<p>2) I get an email almost every day that says:  ""Large Number of Failed Login Attempts from IP (different each time)"".  My webhost (who almost never helps me) told me it was a udp flood or something.</p>

<p>3) I've changed the port for MySQL from the default.  If I ever put it back to the default - I get Loads of over 100 from what must be a constant mysql port flood.</p>

<p>4)  I've reconfigured MYSQL.  Link:  <a href=""http://www.deadlyamazons.com/logs/mycnf.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deadlyamazons.com/logs/mycnf.txt</a></p>

<p>5) I have 3 Joomla Jomsocial networks.  I've spent a couple weeks turning all the mods/plugins off, waiting a day and then turning them back on the next day or later if there isn't any change (there hasn't been).  For example, on Thursday I'll turn off videos, on Friday I'll turn off chat.. etc and nothing changes the load appreciably.   </p>

<p>6) Joomla info:  All SEF turned off - sh404sef completely disabled and removed.  Components: Joomla 1.5.22, Jomsocial 2.0.5, Kunena 1/31/2011, HWDMediashare 11/22/2010  and JBolo Chat 2.7.3, Comet Chat or Envolve Chat.   Page Compression is on, Cache is on 15 mins.  </p>

<p>Hi guys
I'm back with some more info about my poor server.  The server is currently limping along with a load of between 20 and 60 averaging about 30.</p>

<p>I'll add an incentive to solving my problem: $100 via Paypal for an answer that solves the 'load' problem without the suggestion of buying 1 or more extra servers.  Again, these sites worked fine with even higher traffic on a lower powered server.</p>

<p>I just recompiled apache 2.22 adding eaccelerator and zend-optimizer - no change.  The other mod I included was QOS which keeps the # of connections at a lower level.  I've had QOS working for awhile.</p>

<p>Yes I did turn off the port to MySQL I should've mentioned that.</p>

   $(this).attr('title', song_title);
   $(this).attr('alt', ""This works everytime""); 
   });
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>Now the above works but only when I ""stop"" the process by adding in the unwanted alert - I can only guess that the code is executing before it has retrieved the data from the JSON call (?) and the alert enables it to catch up.</p>

<p>I imagine I need another function that executes after the JSON call or for the code to go into the 'success' function but I'm not sure how to keep hold of the 'this' element if that is the case.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to make a status bar notification to the user (i.e. Notification / NotificationManager) from the kernel? </p>

<p>A similar functionality I'm trying to achieve is like connecting to the phone via USB. When the phone detects a USB connection, a status bar notification is produced (and if debugging is enabled, it will tell you that too). How is this done? At some point the kernel sends a signal, but how is the notification generated?</p>

<p>The approach I'm going to try and implement is using the NDK. Create a library that listens/waits for a signal from my LKM, then use then create an app that's just a background service that notifies when the signal is received. </p>

<p>Is there a more elegant solution for this? And I'd like to not have to recompile the AOSP. </p>

"58","SSRS limit length of text but keep full words","<p>In my table I have essentially 2 columns (many more but there is an obvious left side and right side). One of the fields, FIELD1, on the left side comes from a LookupSet() and each ID can have two items from FIELD1. Using a join(lookupset(), vbcrlf) I am able to get both values for the ID and put it into one cell in the table. This works but with the vbcrlf, the row height is increased. This causes a problem because there is data on the right side which cannot have additional space between it.</p>

<p>I did a split(join(lookupset())).getValue(0) for the first row and then the row below it for value 1. With some iif statements to check errors etc, this works.</p>

<p>One problem I solved is that the values for FIELD1 can be longer than the width of the cell, but will not take up more than two. I was able to do some substring magic in oracle like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 1, 70) FROM....
UNION
SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 70) FROM ...
</code></pre>

<p>using sorting, I am able to get up to 4 rows of data per ID which I will be able to split the lookupset and get each value into the table.</p>

<p>My last problem, and hopefully someone can help with is that when I ge the substring, It can cut off words and the next row will start with the rest of the word.
Is there a way, possibly using a regex to make sure to keep words in tact, but also to ensure that the total length returned is &lt; some number of characters? I am happy to abandon any part of the approach i am currently taking if I am off track.</p>

<p>Alright so the size of the backup is getting bigger and bigger every day. So I need a way to backup better.</p>

<p>I'd like some suggestions on how to do this.</p>

<p>But what I was thinking was that every 3 days the third day backups are deleted. But one is kept. </p>

<p>This would mean that my backup total is 73.5gb after 3 days of backups. Then I want to keep that third day backup for 1 week. So on the 10th day it is deleted. So about 85gb of total data is backed up.</p>

<p>Ever hour for 2 days and then 1 hour from every day after that 8 times.</p>

<p>I was thinking the easiest way to do it would be move that 1 hour backup from the third day to a new folder and have a separate script for it that is run daily. However I am not sure how I would go about picking out one of them out from the others and how to delete the ones older than 2 days. </p>

<p>I would likely run these scripts as cronjobs and set them to daily.</p>

<p>I use centOS 64bit 5.7, any tips would be great....incremental backups are NOT an option.</p>

<p>Also, is there an easy way to sync my home PC to a website to download the newest file on there at a particular time? I want this for the backups. I've seen some nice php webpages where it makes a simple filemanager to download files from...perhaps something like this?  </p>

<p>If the JSfiddle link doesn't give you the results I'm describing, then copy and paste the code below into a fresh jsfiddle and try the same experiment. Doing it this way ensures for me that the observe will not work. Regardless of the way it's applied in my application it refuses to observe the keystrokes.</p>

"78","Creating variables with index (using counters)","<p>Is there a way to add an index to a command? For example:</p>

<pre><code>\newcounter{count}
\loop&lt;condition&gt;
  \def\var\Roman{count}{some data}
\repeat
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>\var\Roman{count}</code> should become the variable <code>\varI</code>, <code>\varII</code>, <code>\varIII</code> and so on.</p>

<p>Background: I need to get some data from external files and store it into variables (which I will later use to create a document). Normally every <code>\varI</code> should be the same as every <code>\varII</code>, but I need to check whether it really is the case or not. If not I should return a warning or error.</p>

<hr>

<p>Solution for the first problem is in the comments, but I have a second problem.</p>

<p>Suppose I wrote this:</p>

<pre><code>\newcommand\addindex[3]{  % #1 as name of var, #2 as index and #3 as content
  \expandafter\def\csname #1\Roman{#2}\endcsname{#3}  % thanks to egreg
}

\newcounter{count}
\loop\unless\ifnum\value{count}=5
  \stepcounter{count}
  \addindex{var}{count}{\arabic{count}}
\repeat
</code></pre>

<p>All <code>\var&lt;index&gt;</code> have now as value 5, because they are defined as <code>\arabic{count}</code>, and not their value at the moment. Adding <code>\expandafter</code> before <code>\arabic{count}</code> does not seem to work for some reason...</p>

"79","Mercurial hooks: how to find the current directory on commit","<p>I am trying to create a hook to Mercurial SCM (hg) using C# .NET, to launch a custom C# application on commit or pre-commit.</p>

<p>As a proof-of-concept prototype, I added a location of my custom .exe to the Mercurial.ini file's [hooks] section for pre-commit, and another .exe for commit.
Those .exe apps open on pre-commit and commit, as expected.</p>

<p>However, those executables are only stubs so far.
To make them do what I need, they have to ""know"" the current directory where the commit is about to occur (or has occurred).
Mercurial.ini is located in my user profile directory on Windows.
For example, when I do a commit from an Hg repository located in C:\MyProjects\TestProject, the executables need to know that the work is being done in C:\MyProjects\TestProject.</p>

<p>How can I find out programmatically at runtime from a ""hooked"" executable where the Mercurial command is being executed on the local machine?</p>

Any perspectives on using Ruby and Savon versus Java and Axis? </p>

<p>With Ruby/Savon, it seems that the best thing to do is to skip using the WSDL files and generate the requests based on examples from the Java/Axis program. I tried using the WSDL feature of Savon, but I could not get it to work with the many embedded types and namespaces in the very complex WSDLs.</p>

<p>Looking at the Java/Axis code, there's a huge amount of generated code that isolates the Java developer from knowing about the XML. Has anybody ever tried to replicate Axis in the Ruby world?</p>

<h1>Simple approach that did not work</h1>

<p>(Please note: <code>lsregister</code> can be found under <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister</code>).</p>

<p>Currently I am using the output of <code>lsregister -dump | grep -E '^.*[ \\t]*path:[ \\t]+(\/.*)$' | grep -Eo '\/.*'</code>, which has a few problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.app</code> bundles with newlines (<code>\n</code>, which is valid on UNIX) are not handled correctly (This issue would be fixable by writing a proper parser)</li>
<li><p><code>lsregister</code> doesn't handle correctly weird filename (e.g. containing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_mark"" rel=""nofollow"">RTL mark</a>). <code>lsregister</code> just seems to ignore files with the RTL mark in their name. 
If you want to, you can create a file with RTL in its name by running the following command.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'import shutil; shutil.copytree(u""/Applications/TextEdit.app"", u""/Applications/ThisIsAWeird\u202EApp.app"")'
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, <code>lsregister -dump | grep ThisIsAWeird</code> will <em>not</em> reveal it. But when you right click on a text file and go to ""Open With"" you'll that LaunchServices and Finder still support that file.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/c40Jq.png"" alt=""see yourself""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Simply enumerating all files in <code>/Applications</code> and other directories does not work because LaunchServices is aware of application bundles in arbitrary folders and I also need these apps.</p>

<h1>Other approch that I didn't get to work</h1>

<p>Apparently, there's a private API function called <code>_LSFindApplications</code> which does exactly what I need to do but I can't get it to work and didn't find any inofficial documentation on the internet. (proof it exists: <code>nm /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/LaunchServices  | grep __LSFindApplications$</code>)</p>

<p>I did a lot of thesting and found out that the access to the BlockingCollection bcPort seems to be the problem. bcPort gets constantly chunks from another data-adder thread which is also supposed not to influnce the ui thread. So I dont understand the following:</p>

<p>1.) Why is the GUI getting stuck when I am using different threads for adding and 
packaging the chunks?</p>

<p>2.) Why is this happening when I am using a BC for storing data? Arent these thread safe collections for this certain purpose?</p>

<p>By the way: Windows 7 ResourceManager shows 100% CPU usage during streaming, the chunks contain about 2000 float values each, 4 or 5 of them a rushing in per second. I also disabled the Logger but no effect. The consumer and evaluation threads are disabled. </p>

<p>Besides the ui thread, there is only a thread called ""ReceiveAndSave"" which makes chunks out of incoming float vals (see code, Method ""Add""). the thread ""Producer"" is doing some further packaging and enqeues the chunks for the consumer (deactivated). </p>

"108","Tough routing problem with Linux, Quagga and OpenVPN","<h2>The Setup</h2>

<p>I have an OpenVPN server that acts as a central router. It is configured with ""topology subnet"" command. Clients are Debian Linux nodes and each have one (or more) subnets directly connected to them.</p>

<p>The objective is for any client connected to the VPN to be able to access the subnets connected behind each other client.</p>

<p>In order to spread the routing information, we have installed Quagga on the clients and on the server. This works fine using the OSPF daemon. Routing is enabled on all the clients and the server as well.</p>

<h2>Routing table</h2>

<p>The routing table on the server is the following :</p>

<pre><code>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

</code></pre>

<p>The subnet I want to access is 192.168.100.0/24. The gateway in question responds perfectly fine and I can connect to it alright.</p>

<p>I don't think this will be of any use but here is part of the client routing table :</p>

<pre><code>10.2.10.1       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 tun0

192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
</code></pre>

<h2>Where things start going south</h2>

<p>Pinging from the server (10.8.0.1) to any hosts (including the VPN client interface) in the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet fails. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN client, I see no relevant package. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN server, I see the package in question being sent out.</p>

<p>The real edgy thing is that when I traceroute to a valid IP in the 192.168.100.0 subnet, it doesn't discover any hops (there should be just one). If I traceroute directly to the next hop (10.8.0.4), it responds fine.</p>

<p>I really hope I am being clear as this is quite a complex problem. I'll be happy to provide extra information at your request.</p>

I'm trying to figure out a good solution that won't take several months to develop but will still provide good flexibility for future enhancements.</p>

<p>My options I believe are:</p>

<pre><code>cms+e-commerce plugin (e.g. drupal+ubercart)
e-commerce platform that is extendable (e.g. magento)
framework+e-commerce platform (e.g. ci+magento)

</code></pre>

<p>The site will be similar to etsy where users can have items that they sell with their own portfolio page. The client wants to add many custom features as well. Also, the site will serve up a lot of images and audio.</p>

<p>I'm concerned that using strictly a e-commerce platform will give me a lot of obstacles to overcome rather than use just a cart+framework. I know Magento is written on Zend, but while I have used Magento, I'm not very familiar with Zend and it seems to take quite a while to learn.</p>

<p>I have never used ubercart,wp e-commerce, or virtuemart, so I'm not sure of the limitations. The products will not need to be configurable. But we will need to store financial information. I'm thinking braintree's vault or authorize.net cim.</p>

<p>I'd like to do the framework+ecommerce platform route. But the client would also like a lower price option, I'm leaning towards drupal+ubercart.</p>

I created a .csv file with MATLAB of a sine wave at 440 Hz, and at first I had sampled it at 1 KHz (for 1 second).</p>

<p>My C++ program would then load that file and send the buffer to the soundcard. The problem is that the output was distorted (clipped), and didn't sound like a sine wave at all. Then I thought, maybe the sound card doesn't like 1 kHz sampling rates, so I doubled it, and suddenly everything was fine.</p>

<pre><code>    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \   \
D   E   F
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking for a way to query if for example F is a descendant of A (note: F doesn't need to be a <strong>direct</strong> descendant of F), which, in this particular case would be true. Only a limited amount of potential parent nodes need to be tested against a larger potential descendants node pool.</p>

<p>UPDATE: when testing whether a node is a descendant of a node in the potential parent pool, it needs to be tested against ALL potential parent nodes.</p>

<p>This is what a came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Convert multiway tree to a trie, i.e. assign the following prefixes to every node in the above tree:</p>

<pre><code> A = 1
 B = 11
 C = 12
 D = 111
 E = 112
 F = 121
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then, reserve a bit array for every possible prefix size and add the parent nodes to be tested against, i.e. if C is added to the potential parent node pool, do:</p>

<pre><code>  1    2    3  &lt;- Prefix length

*[1]  [1]  ...
 [2] *[2]  ...
 [3]  [3]  ...
 [4]  [4]  ...
 ...  ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When testing if a node is a descendant of a potential parent node, take its trie prefix, lookup the first character in the first ""prefix array"" (see above) and if it is present, lookup the second prefix character in the second ""prefix array"" and so on, i.e. testing F leads to:</p>

<pre><code> F = 1    2    1

   *[1]  [1]  ...
    [2] *[2]  ...
    [3]  [3]  ...
    [4]  [4]  ...
    ...  ...
</code></pre>

<p>so yes F, is a descendant of C.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This test seems to be worst case O(n), where n = maximum prefix length = maximum tree depth, so its worst case is exactly equal to the obvious way of just going up the tree and comparing nodes. However, this performs much better if the tested node is near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node is somewhere at the top. Combining both algorithms would mitigate both worst case scenarios. However, memory overhead is a concern.</p>

<p>Is there another way for doing that? Any pointers greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Right now I'm setting shaders using <code>D3DXCreateEffectFromFile</code> calls, which create shaders in runtime <em>(once per each shader)</em> from <code>*.fx</code> files.</p>

<p><em>Rendering part for every object (<strong>every patch in my case - see further</strong>) then means something like:</em></p>

<pre><code>// --------------------
// Preprocessing
effect-&gt;Begin();
effect-&gt;BeginPass(0);
effect-&gt;SetMatrix (or Vector or whatever - internal shader parameters) (...)
effect-&gt;CommitChanges();

// --------------------
// Geometry rendering

// Pass the geometry to render
// ...

// --------------------
// Postprocessing

// End 'effect' passes
effect-&gt;EndPass();
effect-&gt;End();
</code></pre>

<p>This is okay, but the profiler shows weird things - <strong><code>preprocessing</code></strong> <em>(see code)</em> takes about 60% of time <em>(I'm rendering terrain object of 256 patches where every patch contains about 10k vertices)</em>.</p>

<p>Actual geometry rendering takes ~35% and postprocessing - 5% of total rendering time.</p>

<p>This seems pretty strange to me and I guess that <code>D3DXEffect</code> interface may not be the best solution for this sort of things. </p>

<p><strong>I've got 2 questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Do I need to implement my own shader controller / wrapper (probably, low-level) and where should I start from?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Would compiling shaders help to somehow improve parameter setting performance?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe somebody knows how to solve this kind of problem / some implemented shader interface or could give some advices about how is this kind of problem solved in modern game engines.</p>

"132","Pipelining within Process Groups","<p>I'm currently reading Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens/Rago.</p>

<p>Within the process group section of the book, the author discusses how process groups are utilized commonly by shells for pipelining.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the argument shown below could have been generated by
  shell commands of the form:</p>
  
  <p>proc1 | proc2 &amp; proc3 | proc4 | proc5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of other resources also discuss the relationship between process groups and pipelining. However, the one thing which I cannot find is an explanation of how the pipelining portion of this is implemented.</p>

<p>I know that in Linux shells like Boune-again shell (BASH), processes in a pipeline are executed in parallel -- that is, in the previous example showing <code>proc3 | proc4 | proc5</code>, all three of these processes are simultaneously executed. The stdin of proc4 is connected to the stdin of proc3. (I also know that MS-DOS used temporary files and did not execute pipes in parallel, but let's ignore that for the moment).</p>

<p>So, I've got proc3, proc4, proc5 all in a process group. Fantastic. How does this actually help with creating the pipelines between them?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, I need to do the following to enable pipelining in a shell which I build:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create N-1 pipelines, where N is the number of processes in the
pipelined statement fork() the shell process N times</li>
<li>In each forked process, I need to use dup2 to properly set up the
shared pipelines</li>
<li>Then, after all of the forked processes have confirmation that they
have all finalized setting up their pipes (likely via some IPC via a
shared memory space), each can then run exec() and actually launch
their respective processes.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, all of the texts which I keep reading act as if process groups provide some magical functionality to create these pipelines -- or they are simply neglecting to mention the procedure I outlined above.</p>

<p>Any comments or advice is always appreciated.</p>

I need the form to populate drop downs from both of the tables with existing values so that the user may select them and create an entry. So far i havent had much luck in this.</p>

CmsGroupModel cmsGroupList = new CmsGroupModel();
model.addAttribute(""cmsAttribute"", cmsAttribute);
return ""/cmsattribute_submit"";
}

<pre><code> AjaxOptions ajaxOpts = new AjaxOptions {
UpdateTargetId = ""tabledata"",
Url = Url.Action(""AppointmentData"")
};
</code></pre>

<p>And than just passing this ""ajaxOpts"" into the Ajax.BeginForm() I am unable to store the ajax options in a variable and than pass that into Ajax.ActionLink. Please see the syntax I am attempting below:</p>

AjaxOptions ajaxOpts = new AjaxOptions
{
    UpdateTargetId = ""catlist-"" + Model.Count,

new AjaxOptions
{
    UpdateTargetId = ""catlist-"" + Model.Count,  
})

<p>It's understandable that when you don't specify the URL for the form and instead just use AjaxOptions as a parameter and jscript is turned off the form will just by default post back to the Action that rendered the page. But is something similar possible for the ActionLink ?  </p>

I measured timings for operations in <code>onCreate</code> method and discovered that more than one second was spent for <code>setContentView(R.layout.main_screen);</code>
I prefer to show previous screen (in my case Splash screen) instead of this black screen during <code>setContentView</code> execution. <strong>How can I rid off this black screen?</strong></p>

<p>Seems android in some way preloads layouts and such problems occurs sometimes. But if I kill my process and start app I always see this black screen.</p>

"161","How to enable windows authentication through a reverse proxy?","<p>Sorry if it is a duplicate, as I am not a security nor network expert I may have missed the correct lingo to find information.</p>

<p>I am working on an application to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses between a web browser and a web server (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3180499/how-to-intercept-and-modify-http-responses-on-server-side"">how to intercept and modify HTTP responses on server side?</a> for the background). I decided to implement a reverse proxy in ASP.Net which forwards client requests to the back-end HTTP server, translates links and headers from the response to the properly ""proxified"" URL, and sends the response to the client after having extracted relevant information from the response. </p>

<p>It is working as expected, except for the authentication part: the web server uses NTLM authentication by default, and just forwarding requests and responses through the reverse proxy does not allow the user to be authenticated on the remote application. Both the reverse proxy and the web application are on the same physical machine and are executed in the same IIS server (Windows server 2008/IIS 7 if that matters). I tried both enabling and disabling authentication on the reverse proxy app with no luck. </p>

<p>I have looked for information about it, and it seems to be related to the ""double-hop problem"", which I do not understand. My question is: is there a way to authenticate the user on the remote application through the reverse proxy using NTLM? If there is none, are there alternative authentication methods I could use? </p>

<p>Even if you don't have a solution to my problem, just pointing me to relevant information about it to help me get out of the confusion would be great!</p>

The problem i face is that it does not allow @Override for non Activity overwritten methods. For example if i implement onErrorListner of MediaPlayer and i set attribute @Override with it then it gives the following compile time error:</p>

<pre><code>The method onError(MediaPlayer, int, int) of type MyActivity must override a superclass method
</code></pre>

<p>And to fix this problem, i am suggested the following</p>

<p>Tough removing the @Override fixes the issue but why does it complain about it and also removing it may cause stopping some functionality of its parent etc?? </p>

<p>I have downloaded many examples which use this ""@Override"" attribute with non-activity methods which proves that this is used and i might be missing some obvious thing. But i cannot run these examples in Eclipse Indigo without removing these ""@Override"" attributes from all the classes.</p>

<li>I change its name which triggers the KVO Declaration (because I changed the 'name' property) which syncs with iCal. Works fine. </li>
<li>I delete the object I just added and somehow it triggers the KVO declaration (thus triggering the method) and puts me into an <strong>infinite loop</strong>.</li>

"218","libquadmath and GNU-gsl ode solver?","<p>I would like a working precision of 40 or more decimal places whilst solving an ODE.
Could anyone tell me if it is possible to get higher precision results using the gsl ODE solver, perhaps using libquadmath? It looks from the gsl_odeiv2 documentation over at <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/gsl-ref.html#Driver"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/gsl-ref.html#Driver</a> that they only take doubles, but is this really the case?</p>

<p>If not could anyone suggest an alternative? Does something like 'odeint' support higher than double precision? Do I have to write my own from scratch?</p>

<p>(For reference my specific problem is at: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13053768/writing-runge-kutta-ode-solver-using-gsl"">Writing Runge-Kutta ODE solver using gsl</a>, now with the bug fixed thanks to Daniel Fischer)</p>

"219","How to put text over an image without absolute positioning or setting the image as backbround","<p>I'm trying to see if it is possible to put some text over an image without using position: absolute or having the image being, the background of an element.<br>
The reason for the constraints is that the HTML code is going into an e-mail, and it turns out that hotmail supports neither.<br>
I remember that when I first began studying CSS, fiddling around with float-ing text around images I often ended up with the text merrily going all over the image. Sadly, I can't reproduce that behavior.</p>

<p>Full story (edited in):<br>
I received a fancy layout from the graphics designer. It's basically a nice background picture, with logos linking to websites and what basically is a ""text goes here"" area in the middle.<br>
As usual in these cases, I'm using tables to make sure that everything stays in place AND works crossbrowser+crossmailclient.<br>
The problem arises from the fact that the middle ""text goes here"" area is not a white rectangle, but has a some background graphics.<br>
Having made some test, it appears that Live Hotmail does not seem to like neither position: absolute or background-image; relative margins are also not good because they'd ruin the rest of the layout.</p>

<p>Current version, works in any other mail client/website:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src='myimage.jpg' width='600' height='400' alt=''&gt;
&lt;p style=""position: absolute; top: 120px; width: 500px; padding-left: 30px;""&gt;
blablabla&lt;br&gt;
yadda yadda&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
...

<p>Of course, “it's not possible” could be a perfectly acceptable answer, but I hope not ;)</p>

"221","sqlite, how to avoid insert new record when I delete parent? I use C# and EF 4.4","<p>Well, in SQLLite there is not exist the possibility to delete on cascade, or I don't know how.</p>

<p>Imagine that I have two tables, Table A and Table B. The table B has the IDtableA field, because is a child, and imagine that I have the following situation:</p>

<p>1.- user A load record 1 from TableA and load it in the context.
2.- user A load all the child records from table B.
3.- user B add a new record to table B that is child of table A.
4.- user A save changes and delete record 1 and all the childs that he loaded in the first time, but not include the new child add by the user B.</p>

<p>So in SqlLite I don't have a model, neither realationships between tables, when user B add a new child, not check if the parent exists.</p>

<p>is it posible ensure reference integrity in Sqlite?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
