\section{Introduction}
In this project, we will extract the topics from a corpus collected from Stack Overflow using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a hadoop cluster. LDA is a statistical model for discovering underlying topics from a collection of documents \cite{blei2003latent}. 

\section{Experiment}
\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset of this project is obtained from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com), which is a platform for data analysis and prediction competitions. The data that we use are posted by Facebook for a keyword extraction competition. The dataset consists the files both for training and testing, of which the training file contains four columns id, title, body, and tags. In this project, only the title and body are used to extract the topics.\\[10pt]
Example:
\begin{verbatim}
id: 1

title: How to check if an uploaded file is an image without mime type?

content:

<p>I'd like to check if an uploaded file is an image file (e.g png, jpg, 
jpeg, gif, bmp) or another file. The problem is that I'm using Uploadify 
to upload the files, which changes the mime type and gives a 'text/octal' 
or something as the mime type, no matter which file type you upload.</p>

<p>Is there a way to check if the uploaded file is an image apart from
 checking the file extension using PHP?</p>

\subsection{Data Cleaning}

Describes the steps we take to do data cleaning.

remove content within \verb+<code>+
