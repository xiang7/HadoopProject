how to control error keys using modelstatewrapper i m using the a service layer with a modelstatewrapper as shown here what s he proper way to control the error keys to use when validating in the service layer so they correspond to the input names in my views e g i have the following viewmodel for a customer and the following viewmodel for some use case s view the user can create two customers on the fly in this use case by entering their names which i use in the view like this in my customer service i ve the following validation method which gets called when creating the customer note that this is a different customer class this is a domain class do you see my problem depending on the view the error should be added with the key or or eventually there will be two errors one with each key instead of just name otherwise the framework won t properly highlight the fields and show the errors what is the proper way to solve this situation neatly i don t want to pass the error key prefix to the service layer because that s a ui concern and not a service layer concern right

composer minimum stability and dependencies of dependencies i m in quite a pickle with a new project and symfony dependencies using composer first some situation i install the symfony framework standard edition v using composer this yields a composer file that has these requirements and no minimum stability node this works fine it installs all the latest stable versions just as it is supposed to next i add a bundle https packagist org packages kunstmaan admin bundle this bundle depends on doctrine doctrine fixtures bundle in dev master https packagist org packages doctrine doctrine fixtures bundle and that bundle depends on doctrine data fixtures with https packagist org packages doctrine data fixtures now when i run composer update in the project it tells me that there is nothing to satisfy the doctrine data fixtures dependency either a typo in the name or no stable version available since the minimum stability defaults to stable it does want to install the doctrine fixtures bundle in dev stability since putting dev master automatically puts this dependency in dev stability but this does nothing for the deps of this dep they keep wanting to install as stable since that is my minimum stability at this point i can fix this by adding doctrine data fixtures dev master or with dev to my composer json in the project but since this is only one example knpmenubundle fosuserbundle etc etc i will have to manually go and add all deps of deps that don t install to my own composer file another solution would be dropping minimum stability of my project to dev but at that time all my deps including the stable ones like symfony will install their dev version and not the tagged release

not show the last screen when launching ios app my app has a feature that when enabled presents a decoy screen whenever the app is launched the user then has to tap in a secret knock to dismiss the decoy screen and see the password screen the problem is when the app is launched a split second before the decoy screen is presented the screen that was active before the app was suspended is shown it s shown for just a split second but depending on what the user was previously doing it can be awkward anyway this little glitch practically defeats the whole purpose of the decoy screen the app is a free download so if you have an ios device please download the app and activate the decoy feature on the options screen to see what i m trying to say here and finally to the question is there a way to not have the app present the last active screen when it s launched i want the decoy screen to be the first thing to come up whenever the app is launched without that split second of the previous content i know i can set the uiapplicationexitsonsuspend to yes on the plist file to work around the problem but that would force the app to quit and not suspend i would really like to keep the suspend feature working hope i made it clear enough

iphone app launch image with different backgrounds this question is similar to this one my iphone app allows the user to select the background image to use for the main screen therefore depending on the background image selected by the user the launch image screenshot of the main screen will likely display the wrong background image when the main screen is finally loaded and the launch image is removed it will be quite ugly for the background image to change suddenly to what the user has selected does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this should i use some kind of splash screen i thought i read in apple s hig that this was not allowed or maybe i should somehow transition the user s selected background image into the view after the launch image is dismissed and the main screen is visible any thoughts

tree algorithm i was thinking earlier today about an idea for a small game and stumbled upon how to implement it the idea is that the player can make a series of moves that cause a little effect but if done in a specific sequence would cause a greater effect so far so good this i know how to do obviously i had to make it be more complicated because we love to make it more complicated so i thought that there could be more than one possible path for the sequence that would both cause greater effects albeit different ones also part of some sequences could be the beggining of other sequences or even whole sequences could be contained by other bigger sequences now i don t know for sure the best way to implement this i had some ideas though i could implement a circular n linked list but since the list of moves never end i fear it might cause a stack overflow the idea is that every node would have n children and upon receiving a command it might lead you to one of his children or if no children was available to such command lead you back to the beggining upon arrival on any children a couple of functions would be executed causing the small and big effect this might though lead to a lot of duplicated nodes on the tree to cope up with all the possible sequences ending on that specific move with different effects which might be a pain to maintain but i am not sure i never tried something this complex on code only theoretically does this algorithm exist and have a name is it a good idea i could implement a state machine then instead of wandering around a linked list i d have some giant nested switch that would call functions and update the machine state accordingly seems simpler to implement but well doesn t seem fun nor ellegant giant switchs always seem ugly to me but would this work better suggestions i am good but i am far inexperienced the good thing of the coding field is that no matter how weird your problem is someone solved it in the past but you must know where to look someone might have a better idea than those i had and i really wanted to hear suggestions

why does entity framework throw string or binary data would be truncated exception if you take a look at the code below you ll see that i m attempting to add the same data to my context in two different ways one method a which i typically use with no problems keeps throwing this exception when i call savechanges on my context an error occurred while updating the entries see the inner exception for details inner exception string or binary data would be truncated the statement has been terminated i know the data isn t too long for the database field because method b which uses exactly the same data as method a but which is for obvious reasons not the ideal way to insert works fine the only difference between them is that in method b i m creating a new instance of my entity class in the method that talks to the dbcontext and assigning to its properties the property values of the entity instance passed into that method can anyone explain what might be happening thanks for any help advice you can provide edit whether or not entitymanager addentity method a works seems to depend on where it s called from the automated test that adds a patient using nunit runs fine but when the method is called from a winforms application assembly it doesn t work

relative path for zend log in zend framework i am trying to work out the best way to configure my zend log writer stream instance to write to a filename relative to my application path for example with the following config the normal way to init your loggger would be to either use the application bootstrap resource or do the following the problem with this is that the zend log writer stream factory method will try to access the file relative to the current script execution not the application path as it s almost always the index php inside public that kicks this off usually it s not a drama however when i execute individual scripts inside my unit testing directories it will use that directory to base the path on ideally i want to be able to set so that it always uses a predictable location i would rather not have to hack the factory method of a zend log inherited class to make this work i would love to hear how others have solved this problem 
facebook graph api not returning all events i m using the facebook graph api via the php sdk to fetch a list of events attached to a facebook page the page has events all public if i query them from the links in the developer documentation i e with the sample access key it gives you there i can see all fifteen of them that sample url the one that works fine is if though i do the same request via the php sdk that is from calling then it returns only nine events not the full fifteen i ve tried seemingly every combination of parameters i ve tried ing it to i ve tried setting various s i ve set either or both and i ve tried to think of all the gotchas the events are definitely public and show up if i visit the page s events tab while logged out of facebook whatever i do i just get those same nine events mocking me with their incompleteness does anyone have any ideas the events that aren t showing are the most recently added ones if that makes any difference though they were added to facebook days rather than hours or minutes ago i can t think why that would make a difference though and i ve had events show up within minutes of being added before thanks in advance guys

form for calls model method without submit i have an index page for admin part of my project where and are public instance methods in model for some reason when i load this index page it automatically calls method which sets corresponding field to same behavior applies to with if i remove with bit action from corresponding controller is very simple i realize this must be normal behavior but what i would expect is to call method only when i submit corresponding form is there a way to fix it thank you update just for the future reference including my own it is easier to use helper for things like that 
cleaner way to convert array of nullable datetime to nullable double i have a i need to convert to any way to clean up this one liner or should i just resort to a function i can t call a method on t without checking that it s null hence the tertiary operator and i have to coalesce it as well so that i can call oadate hence the coalesce and filler datetime minvalue that will never be hit it gets the job done in one line but it is looking a little perl like maybe an extension method that way i can hide the ugliness and just do something along the lines of

eclipse giving out an error while adding springframework dependency in maven pom i created a maven project in eclipse using the webapp artifact and put the following lines in the pom file upon reading an online tutorial in the tutorial however the version is i replaced it with release considering its the latest version but for this version eclipse is giving out an error what does this mean can i add the required jar files to a lib folder and ask pom file to take it from there as its being done in another tutorial on spring source website that uses ant also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial i am completely new to maven in fact only a beginner in developing web applications using java i did some tutorials from spring source and could deploy and run a spring mvc hello world app on apache tomcat for this i used ant and found it a great tool but as i checked out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant i am finding it a bit difficult to understand though thanks

when installing jquery why does my delete link break i have a rails application that can create and delete products an index page lists all the products next to each product in the list is a delete link this looks like this in the html this has been working fine i ve reached the point where i want to install jquery in my application i followed the steps available on several web pages like this or this for example after installing jquery the above delete link breaks instead of processing the action in rails attempts to process the action my guess is that it has something to do with the fact that web browsers can t send requests natively so rails fakes such requests with javascript which is why i had the following line before attempting the jquery install edit something during the jquery install must have made it such that the javascript used to fake the request no longer works resulting in the action being called but what exactly is happening i don t know anyone have any ideas thank you

why most people change from being a contractor to full time at my companies but not the other way around i have seen most people changed from being a contractor to being a full time employee but not the other way around and that happened in startups that had maybe chance of ipo or being acquired and another that had maybe a chance as far as i know the rate even for a year experience graphics designer or a programmer can be to an hour while a programmer with years of experience may get per year so the programmer with years of programming experience earns per month at the same time the programmer with year of experience or the graphics designer will get per month x days x hours i know i have to buy my own insurance but i can t imagine buying those for each month maybe at most i probably need to pay social security fica both way myself and as self employed x but still each month there will be extra of income so is the above calculation correct but most often i do see contractors wanting or becoming full time but not full time employees becoming a contractor does somebody know what the reason is

how to extract the layers from an image jpg png etc given an image such as the cakephp logo how can this image be converted back into a psd with the layers as a human i can easily work out how to translate this back to a psd with layers i can tell that the background is a circular shape with star edges so the circular star part is at the back the cake image is on top of this and the words cakephp is over all of these two images i can use photoshop gimp tools to separate these images into three images and fill in the areas in between then i have three layers as a human it is easy to work out the layering of most logos and images and many images have multiple layers the cakephp logo is just one example images in the real world also have a layering there may be a tree layer on top of a background of grass i need a general way to convert from an image back to the layered representation ideally a software solution in absence of a programmed solution are there any papers or research which solve this problem or are related to this problem i am mostly interested in converting human constructed images such as logos or website titles back to layered representation i want to point out some benefits of doing this if you can get this image to a layered representation automatically then it is more easy to modify the image for example maybe you want to make the cake smaller if the computer already layered the cake on top of the red background you can just scale the cake layer this allows for layer adjustment of images on websites which do not have layer information already

interview questions for user interface data visualization design there are a ton of lists out there of interview questions to test the candidate s programming aptitude but my company is very ui focused and everyone is expected to be able to both code and design a decent ui so once i ve seen that the candidate can implement recursive fibonacci and tell me its orders of growth in time and space i want to make sure that they can design an interface that won t make the user run screaming from our app what questions do you ask to test a candidate s interface design data visualization skills i m especially interested in open ended design questions that let you see the candidate s thought process as they go about designing an interface a monopoly question for ui design if you will for example this is the question i use in harry potter the marauder s map is a magical map of hogwarts castle that also shows the real time positions of everyone in the castle how would you design a ui that would let you see not only everyone s current positions but their positions over the last hours this results in a lot of interesting discussion as the candidate thinks about the pros and cons of various representations do you use paths timelines how do you represent someone sitting in the same place for an hour how many histories can should you see at once i watch for people getting hung up on little details using ui components incorrectly or just lack of design sense with the good candidates i see them drawing parallels to similar well known interfaces thinking deeply about the tradeoffs of their design choices and asking good requirements questions e g how many people live in hogwarts

temporally flat one way quantum computing i am a physicist at heart and so i think one way quantum computing is brilliant in particular graph state measurement based quantum computing mbqc has been a really nice development in quantum computing research as originated by raussendorf amp briegel one just needs to prepare a multi partite entangled state as described by a graph and then perform sequential measurements on each node or qubit adaptive measurements for deterministic computations another excellent aspect of this approach is that clifford circuits can be implemented in a single round of measurements as shown by raussendorf browne and briegel these circuits can be classically simulated efficiently as shown by gottesman and knill so it is an interesting connection between classical simulation and temporal resources however not all temporally flat graph state mbqc circuits consisting of one round of measurements are believed to be simulatable classically for example families of circuits in the quantum circuit model consisting of commuting gates called iqp circuits as introduced by shepherd and bremner can be implemented in single time step in mbqc these iqp circuits are believed not to be classically simulatable in computational complexity terms it would lead to a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy see also a nice description of a class of circuits implemented in one time step here given that commuting diagonal unitaries can have some interesting behaviour but non commuting circuits be classically simulatable it would be interesting if there were non commuting circuits that can be implemented but not yet shown to be classically simulatable anyway my question is are there other interesting circuits that can be implemented in a single time step in mbqc though i would prefer relations to computational complexity or classical simulation i would find anything interesting edit after joe s excellent answer below i should clarify a couple of things as joe said and somewhat embarrassingly i have said in one of my own papers single measurement round mbqc circuits are in iqp to be more precise i am interested in interesting circuits in the problems in iqp that can be implemented in one round of measurements in mbqc clifford circuits are an interesting example if there any other examples which are classically simulatable that would be extremely interesting since simulating iqp circuits is believed to be unlikely classically it would be interesting to find instances of circuits that are

seriousness of a smart disk error how long will it last i have an tb data disk and the bios and windows are reporting a smart error at least i get a smart event but it doesn t indicate how serious the failure could be my system is about months old including the disk so the warranty will cover the damage unfortunately i lack a second disk of tb in size which i can use to make a full backup the most important data on this disk is safe but there s a lot of work data which can be regenerated but this would cost a lot of time so i ordered an usb disk of tb which will arrive in three days by then i can make a full backup of the data and afterwards it can crash but will the disk live that long well i won t use the pc as long as i can t make a backup how serious is such a smart event i know it s serious enough to have it replaced but will it live for another week or could it die any moment update i purchased an tb external disk and spent most of the day making a backup of the tb disk it survived that i then received a new disk since it was still under warranty and replaced the hard disk then i had to spend most of a day again to put back the backup i need to send back the faulty disk and now have an additional external disk which could always be practical the smart error report did not cause any failures on the original disk i won t advise to ignore these warnings but the disk still has enough life in it to last a few more days just make sure you have a good back up and oh the horror of having to make a complete backup such a huge disk if your data is important make sure you have something that supports incremental backups and lots of space in my case the data wasn t very important just practical to have on disk together

arc weak ivar released before being returned when building for release not debug i have a class that creates an object lazily and stores it as a weak property other classes may request this object but must obviously keep a strong reference to it to keep the object from being deallocated when the scheme is xcode is set to build for debug things work just fine an object can call and get back when the scheme is set to build for release returns my guess is that the compiler is optimising my code by seeing that is not used further in the accessor method itself so the weak variable is being set to before returning it seems that i would have to create a strong reference before actually returning the variable which i can only think to do using a block but would be messy and i d rather avoid it is there some kind of keyword i can use with the return type to stop the ivar from being nilled so soon

jquery val and checkboxes is there some rationale for being useless for checkbox controls whereas it is useful for getting input data consistently across every other input control e g for checkboxes at appears to always return on regardless of the checkbox state for other input controls that don t actually have a value attribute e g select and textarea it behaves as you would expect see http jsfiddle net jamietre sdf h i can t think of a good reason why it wouldn t return or failing that at least return on only when checked and an empty string when not failing that at least always return an empty string given that checkboxes have no attribute obviously i know how to get the value using but here s the situation i am developing a simple so far anyway c jquery implementation to do html parsing on the server and i am trying to be completely faithful to jquery s implementation so it behaves consistently on either the client or server against the same dom but this just seems stupid and i m having a hard time getting myself to actually code value to return on for a checkbox no matter what but if i don t it won t be consistent so i m trying to understand is there some reason for doing this does it serve some purpose or is it simply an artifact of some kind would anyone ever use the method against a checkbox if so why if not why did the jquery architects decide on this approach to make it not useful

why is an even odd split faster for mergesort mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input into several parts and solves the parts recursively there are several approaches for the split function one way is to split down the middle that approach has some nice properties however we ll focus on a method that s a little bit faster even odd split the idea is to put every even position element in one list and every odd position in another this is straight from my lecture notes why exactly is it the case that the even odd split is faster than down the middle of the array i m speculating it has something to do with the list being passed into mergesort and having the quality of already sorted but i m not entirely sure could anyone shed some light on this

links between switches for iscsi we inherited a san vmware iscsi setup with both dell and hp equipment purchased for it but not fully setup and we need to get some additional switches to make it all work but we re getting different feedback from the vendors on what s needed for the inter links between the switches this is a diagram of what we believe we want to end up with http www gthomson us san vmware project jpg esxi environment running about windows vms will be adding more once further along for the most part the left rds of the diagram is setup hp servers for esxi and hp p lefthand san but currently there is just a single hp procurve g switch dedicated to gb iscsi we want to make that redundant on higher end switches we also have a dell equallogic ps e san and a couple dell r servers the equallogic is gb iscsi and no switches were purchased to put it to use we d like to have two realms one realm with gb iscsi redundant switches with the hp lefthand san and hp servers one realm with gb iscsi redundant switces with the dell equallogic and dell servers and use one vcenter setup to manage and migrate systems between the two gb and gb realms if when it makes sense to when we migrate from one to the other we want to migrate both the host and storage i e would not be wanting the host on the gb side and the storage on the gb side or vice versa one vendor tells us none of the switches need interlinks for this all to work the other vendor tells us all the switches need to be interlinked for this to work from what i understand so far and i m very new to all of this hence the diagram to help me understand what s happening and what s needed on the gb side of things the switches would need to be inter linked because the equallogic requires it on the gb side left side of the diagram do the two gb switches need to be interlinked for the hp lefthand san side of things or some other reason my gut feeling tells me this inter link isn t needed because the lefthand san makes sure all data is written to at least two different physical devices so the link redundancy is actually handled in that way rather than inter links at the switch level does there need to be inter links between the gb side and the gb side at the switches and if so why and how do those inter links get done each gb to each gb using the uplink ports on the gb going to regular ports on the gb my understanding was that vmotion for both host migrations and storage migrations would happen across the vmotion nics rather than across the iscsi links and if that s the case why would the links directly between the gb and gb switches be needed for anything we don t have any goals of automatic failover from gb to gb side or vice versa

most efficient way of updating minutes ago type text in wpf i currently use a valueconverters in xaml to display my viewmodel datetime fields in x minutes ago format i need to have them updated periodically without causing too much overhead at any one time i have a dozen on screen and a few dozen off screen what is the best strategy in the constructor of the viewmodel object have them register themselves to a static viewrefresher that periodically goes through all the objects and fires propertychanged handlers on the registered fields refresh the content items control objects that are holding my objects something else i will go ahead and try both approaches above while i wait for answers and report back in case it helps someone else update ok thanks to csteinmueller for putting me on the events path much cleaner than registering deregistering objects i believe the following strategy should not be leaky would have been nice if i could derive from datetime directly instead of inlining as a field but it s sealed update this does seem to have a memory leak after all you need to unhook event for datetimec to be garbage collected or use a weak reference

load testing silverlight application that uses csla dataportal we need to perform a load test on a silverlight application that uses data portal to communicate with the server since the point of these tests is to evaluate application server s performance i ignore the client part and send soap requests directly to the server but in doing so i ve encountered a few problems since jmeter is a preferable tool but it doesn t support soap msbin content type i m having problems decoding binary xmls that are sent both by client and by server using fiddler and a wcf binary plug in i ve noticed that soap messages contain fields like clientcontext globalcontext criteriadata and so on that are base encoded binary data from what i understand this is the way csla data portal exchanges information by sending serialized objects encoded in base so what i would like to know is is it possible to make jmeter able to receive and send msbin encoded xml files preferably without using any external applications and if i use a different load testing tool like wapt or loadrunner that already has this functionality how do i parametrize the serialized data or maybe there are other solutions free ones if possible any help would be greatly appreciated

 sign in as different user not taking in some instances of wss or moss when you use the sign in as different user option the new login doesn t take is there any known issue here usually logging out and then logging back in with the second user does work this seems like a pretty big problem and i ve seen it on and off over the years mostly while testing with different identities update i m seeing it in several hosted wss situations so i don t actually know what authentication they are using interestingly i don t see it in some hosted wss situations too and consistently within the instance this might tell us that the authentication method might matter update another piece of info i should have included in the first place the reason that i m asking this is that the spservices spgetcurrentuser in spservices sometimes returns the previous user all i m doing in that function is loading the page and pulling the name from the page it s the column with the label account but the internalname is name here s the spservices function one would like to think that this page would always represent the currently logged in user but sometimes it represents the prior user not good update i may have come up with a fix for this in my spservices library at least it doesn t solve the larger problem that sharepoint seems to have though i added a unique query string parameter just the current time to the call to userdisp aspx in spgetcurrentuser per arunduttgp s suggestion this seems to force the browser to do a hard refresh on the page in the ajax call getting the correct values for the logged in user even when the current sharepoint page is showing the prior user incorrectly

how can i implement user friendly boolean logic in a web form gui currently i have a web application where a user can use dropdown lists to generate sql select statements like so column select dropdown operator dropdown lt lt value select dropdown the user can do this multiple times and the filters are currently all anded together i want to add the possibility of creating or statements i could very easily add ors in the case where the columns are the same but what about complex logic statements like a or b or c and d or e or f and g how can i let users create such statements in a user friendly way edit to specify user friendly for a general audience currently i work with developers that occasionally hand code sql queries for a non technical client that needs specific information from our database the goal is that this web app will remove the need for us to hand code them by giving the client an easy to use tool to do it themselves edit currently the app is not being used by end users the only data i have as to its use are previous handwritten sql queries and thus the kind of queries the client asks for given that i could simplify it e g limit the users ability to generate queries to the kinds of queries they tend to ask for but i want to see if anybody has experience communicating boolean logic simply and completely in guis thank you for your time

clearing a collection of collections clear every item first or just clear all at once suppose i have a collection of some kind that itself contains collections e g dictionary of string list of myclass if i want to clear the collection entirely does it make any sense to clear every individual child collection before clearing the parent collection like so or does this really accomplish nothing more than simply i m asking if there is any reason whatsoever performance safety clarity etc to use the first method i generally use the second method myself as i m assuming that it implicitly achieves what the first method does anyway but we all know how dangerous it is to assume sometimes hence this question edit today in my own application i have seen compelling evidence that the first method might be preferable in certain cases in my application i have some global collections dictionaries containing lists as in the example code above that are populated when the user clicks a button labelled load data when the user clicks unload data to start back at the beginning formerly i was clearing these collections using the second method above the problem was that when the user clicked load data a second time the application would suddenly become very slow eventually it would finish populating the collections again but at a snail s pace i couldn t figure out how to fix this problem until i finally tried the first method above now reloading and repopulating the collections works just as quickly as loading them the first time based on the answers posted so far it sounds like i must have other code somewhere referencing the child collections however it doesn t look to me like i do the only places i reference these children are where i iterate over their parents if the parents are cleared then they should have no children that the code is aware of correct hopefully someone can help me to understand how either these references are still lingering around or else what is going on that i am overlooking

obtaining all possible states of an object for a np complete problem in python not sure that the example nor the actual usecase qualifies as np complete but i m wondering about the most pythonic way to do the below assuming that this was the algorithm available say you have and some operation that requires a group of persons the key value is here whether the person is happy or sad hence given persona personb personc persond i d like to end up a list of the possible combinations of sad and happy persons i e is there a good pythonic way of doing this i was thinking about list comprehensions and modifying the object so that you could call it and get returned two objects true and false but the comprehension formats i ve seen would require me to know the number of persons in advance i d like to do this independent of the number of persons edit assume that whatever that operation that i was going to run on this is part of a larger problem set we need to test out all values of person for a given set in order to solve our problem i e i know this doesn t look np complete right now any ideas thanks

asp net ajax and usercontrols handling client side scripting i have a usercontrol that i want to include in a page multiple times programatically based on some business rules currently the control has a javascript function that must be called on the asp net ajax event i m using a pattern where the master page has a function that calls a function on any contenttemplate if the function exists the contenttemplate that holds the usercontrol in question would then be responsible for calling the appropriate function on the usercontrol during this event right now the javascript is inline in the for the usercontrol but i have a feeling that i ll need to use the property to inject it via code behind my question is how do i make sure that my function names don t get clobbered and make sure that the appropriate method gets called for each usercontrol fyi the code that needs to get executed for each usercontrol is a block of jquery that creates a multi select control from a standard html edit was suggested but this runs before the dom is finished loading wrapping the function in a jquery document ready doesn t seem to help the user control is running inside of an so i don t really have a choice about how to call this script 
about compatibility between various equation editor for various word processor i ve been so tied of finding a compatible way of editing math equations in ms word in win and in libreoffice in linux of course i know tex is the universal way but i don t use tex unless i write my formal paper so let s keep the discussion within ms office and libreoffice or maybe other word processer i ve tried several equation editors mathtype aurora texmaths but the equations produced by them are not compatible editable in one while noneditable in another but i found that all these equation editors provide a way to convert their own equation into latex form so it seems that they are all internally latex compatible and i think the generated equation should have contained the latex code right the equation can not just be a totally picture if so why the editor can edit it and resolve it to latex but how can i extract the hidden information behind the equation without the equation editor double click the equation without the right equation editor will show that it is just a picture if i can extract the hidden latex code of equations or if i can hide the latex code into the equation then compatibility will not be a problem though it is still not so convinient

using pthreads with cuda design questions i am writing some code that requires some disk i o and invoking a library that i wrote that does some computation and gpu work and then more disk i o to write the results back to a file i would like to create this as multi threaded code because the files are quite large i want to be able to read in portion of the file send it to the gpu library and write a portion back to a file the disk i o involved is quite large like gb and the computation is fairly quick on the gpu my question is more of a design question should i use separate threads to pre load data that goes to the gpu library and only have the main thread actually execute the calls to the gpu library and then send the resulting data to other threads to be written back out to disk or should i go ahead and have all of the separate threads each do their own part grab a chucnk of data execute on the gpu and write to disk and then go get the next chunk of data i am using cuda for my gpu library is cuda smart enough to not try to run two kernels on the gpu at once i guess i will have to do the management manually to ensure that two threads dont try to add more data to the gpu than it has space any good resources on the subject of multithreading and cuda being used in combination is appreciated

variant type conversion for calculations required i m trying to convert a vb script to a c script the ouput of the new script is not the same as the old script but after a lot of testing i begin to wonder if the results yet are equal the old vb script start with an array of doubles and then calls a function where the arrays are passed by reference this function has a header that has a variant type array instead of double types i have tested the data before entering the method and to that point the input is equal then this method does some calculations with the data in those arrays and the output is not the same anymore if i write out the data immediately after entering the method i already see other data in the old script in my new script i do the same calculations but the input after entering the method there is still the same as it was passed to the method now is my question that if i am sure the calculations are correct the output could be equal so that they are just presented in another format thanks in advance and my excuses for my writing skills my native language is dutch hence newscript oldscript

how come a non const reference cannot bind to a temporary object why is it not allowed to get non const reference to a temporary object which function returns clearly this is prohibited by c standard but i am interested in the purpose of such restriction not a reference to the standard it is clear that the lifetime of the object cannot be the cause because constant reference to an object is not prohibited by c standard it is clear that the temporary object is not constant in the sample above because calls to non constant functions are permitted for instance could modify the temporary object in addition allows you to fool the compiler and get a link to this temporary object and that solves our problem in addition they say assigning a temporary object to the const reference extends the lifetime of this object and nothing is said about non const references though my additional question does following assignment extend the lifetime of temporary object

repurpose ttys after successful boot up consider a headless device that uses a serial port for console i configured it so that during bootup all phases can be followed using that serial port i e bios boot loader kernel and login are configured the login tty is configured as per the line below in now this may sound a bit exotic but since the serial port is only used for maintenance in case of absent network connectivity i would like to use that port again in the particular scenario the port would be used to connect to another headless machine that is less reliable and is stored in the same remote location this would allow to access the less reliable machine via serial connection remotely e g over ssh so how can i repurpose the ttys or generally any serial port after successfully booting into the system how can i kill the respective instances note the without having to change which would defeat the whole purpose because if the system does not come up with network connectivity next time serial connectivity is essential for repair

wcf async callback setup for polled device i have a wcf service setup to control a usb fingerprint reader from our net applications this works fine and i can ask it to enroll users and so on the reader allows identification it tells you that a particular user has presented their finger as opposed to asking it to verify that a particular user s finger is present but the device must be constantly polled while in identification mode for its status when a user is detected the status changes what i want is for an interested application to notify the service that it wants to know when a user is identified and provide a callback that gets triggered when this happens the wcf service will return immediately and spawn a thread in the background to continuously poll the device this polling could go on for hours at a time if no one tries to log in what s the best way to acheive this my service contract is currently defined as follows in my method can i easily spawn a worker thread to poll the device or is it easier to make the wcf service asynchronous

array performance very similar to linkedlist what gives so the title is somewhat misleading i ll keep this simple i m comparing these two data structures an array whereby it starts at size and for each subsequent addition there is a realloc call to expand the memory and then append the new malloced element to the n position a linked list whereby i keep track of the head tail and size and addition involves mallocing for a new element and updating the tail pointer and size don t worry about any of the other details of these data structures this is the only functionality i m concerned with for this testing in theory the ll should be performing better however they re near identical in time tests involving up to elements my gut feeling is that the heap is large i think the data segment defaults to mb on redhat i could be wrong anyway realloc is first checking to see if space is available at the end of the already allocated contiguous memory location n if the n th position is available there is not a relocation of the elements instead realloc just reserves the old space the immediately following space i m having a hard time finding evidence of this and i m having a harder time proving that this array should in practice perform worse than the ll here is some further analysis after reading posts below update i ve modified the code to have a separate list that mallocs memory every th iteration for both the ll and the array for million additions to the array there are almost consistently moves there s no concept of moving for the ll i ve done a time comparison they re still nearly identical here s some output for million additions i would expect the times to be drastically different with moves the array addition is requiring more assignment and more comparison to get and check the return value of realloc to ensure a move occurred update i ran an ltrace on the testing that i posted above and i think this is an interesting result it looks like realloc or some memory manager is preemptively moving the array to larger contiguous locations based on the current size for iterations a memory move was triggered on iterations which is pretty close to a summation sequence i find this to be pretty interesting thought i d post it

purpose and use of threadlocal class i was going through the threadlocal class documentation and wondered in what scenarios it can be used first i thought it can be used in those scenarios where we have third party legacy classes and we want to handle synchronization issues then i looked at other examples of threadlocal and found out that threadlocal wont help there because in most of those cases we have single object which is shared across all threads is this correct with further understanding now i can think of using the threadlocal class in those scenarios where we need a seperate object for each thread and if a specific thread interacts with an object in threadlocal the same object is used every time instead of creating a new one is this correct or am i missing something

mysql unique index by multiple fields we have a special kind of table in our db that stores the history of its changes in itself so called self archived table it stores coverages of our subscribers field current indicates if this is a current original record c or history record h we could only have one current c coverage for the given subscriber but we can t create a unique index with fields subscriber id and current because for any given c record there could be any number of h records history of changes so the index should only be unique for current c and any subscriber id that could be done in oracle db using something like materialized views where we could create a materialized view that would only include records with current c and create a unique index with these fields subscriber id current the question is how can this be done in mysql

reducing end user latency in herokuapp this question is a follow up to my previous question about scaling in heroku what i ve noticed is that when i use my app it doesn t feel quite so smooth i ve used plugins like yslow that consistently tell me that the majority of time is being spent on the server side in generating the html new relic seems to show that my app is spending a lot of time in request queuing as shown here and here however i also have this bit of information showing me that seems like a really really big discrepancy between a ms processing time on the server vs sec response time that the user is experiencing what does this mean what is the best way to reduce the latency for the user again i m a complete newbie and all help is much appreciated

approximating geodesic distances on the sphere by euclidean distances of a transformed sphere is there a way to find a function f mathbb s rightarrow mathbb r of class c minimizing int mathbb s times mathbb s d f x f y delta x y dx dy where d stands for the euclidean distance in mathbb r and delta the geodesic distance on the sphere mathbb s or d could stand for the squared euclidean distance and delta the square geodesic distance if this makes the problem simpler the goal is thus to approximate geodesic distances by euclidean distances of transformed points i tried to perform a multi dimensional scaling to get this least square solution for a finite set of point but it seems that the solution was just the identity or a uniform scaling is that right thanks

how to test an object when i can t access state i have a factory class that creates an object based on a parameter it receives the parameter is an identifier that tells it which object it should create its first step is to use the data access layer to pull information for the object its next step is to do some cleansing transformations on the data finally it creates the required object and returns it i want to ensure that the cleansing transformation step went ok but the object that it returns does not expose any state so i m not sure how to test it easily the data access layer and the database structure can t change because they have to work with legacy code i could test it further on in the system after the object gets used but that would lead to big tests that are hard to maintain i ve also thought of exposing the state of the object or putting the responsibility in another class and testing that but both those options seem like i m changing the system for testing any thoughts on other ways to test something like this

how does svn store commit time i am working on a project that involves extracting details from a svn server using svnkit my project is already complete and has been working we for a while now during the testing i noticed something rather very strange the commit times my extract data seems is alway different from whats there in svn logs i couldnt find any code in my project that could be inducing this difference but now i am looking as to how svn server stores the commit time in itself as we have developer working from different part of the world thus resulting in different timezones i was thinking that svn might be storing time after converting them to gmt or timezone of the system on which svn server is running but that does not seem to be happening instead the times are stored as per the time when the commit was done and in that local timezone itself i have been unable to find any substantial document on internet to support my theory so far can anybody in brief explain as how svn store the commit time for each change documentaion links referring to this will be of great help

java arrays length i was wondering about the implementation of length of a java array i know that using arrayname length gives us the number of elements in the array but was wondering if this is a method function or it is just a data member of array i guess it must be a data member as we do not use when invoking it but if it is a data member how when is the value of this length assigned computed sorry if this is a noob question but was unable to find a helpful explanation anywhere although i guess it is a rather silly question but something that has been bugging me

what tools are needed to make a social browser game background info i ve recently decided to take on a project of making a social browser game i have nothing large in mind at the moment but in particular i want to experiment with making a facebook app for fun that me and my friends can play perhaps it gets more popular but let me not get sidetracked firstly i would like to state that i feel i am above average at programming in general i have developed a php mysql website made a rough d game engine in java some embedded c programming etc to give an idea of the level of help i require as stated i know php and i can work with sql databases my javascript is perhaps mediocre as i have not used it extensively but i am learning and not finding it too difficult i don t know flash at all but it seems the trend is towards html and canvas to the point question i would like to start with html javascript mysql database and php however i am not too sure how to integrate this into a game my main concern is what tool to use for communication between client and server am i wrong in saying that all relevant calculations for instance for resources are kept server side as advanced users can possible hack secondly how would you send data between client and server obviously posting and reloading the page won t work i have used ajax before but i m not sure if this is the route to go i don t require an intricate answer although i won t complain if i get one i d be appreciative if someone can simply point me in the right direction thank you i guess i should add that the game should be interactive not text based as simply posting would work here anyone interested in the same problem check this out nodejs ajax vs socket io pros and cons the reason i didn t find this before was that i was not aware of socket connections

jqgrid search not populating the form i ve been banging my head against this for about two days now i have jqgrid set up to sort page filter using single field search and i m saving the sort page filter information in a cookie and reloading it when the user returns to the page so that if they jump off the grid page to view information about one of the entities in the grid they ll see the same list when they come back later it took quite a bit of work to get the search data into the call to the server side on reload sorting and paging were a piece of cake but i have one piece left before i can call it complete the grid does load the right filtered data when the user comes back to the page but when they click the search button the form shows in its initial state instead of having the previously selected search filter information i ve searched for other answers and have tried many things extending postdata reloading the grid specifying searchfield searchoper searchstring in the options for jqgrid and for the search etc and nothing seems to work the interesting thing is that even reloading the page multiple times preserves the data in postdata and through to the server it just doesn t display in the search dialog i m using jqgrid here s my javascript code edit since i haven t had any answers i implemented a kludge for now in the jqgridfilteraftershow event i added the following productfiltersetvalues starts as true if there are any filter criteria present in the cookie

creating array populated by images from a pdf using php and imagemagick i m trying to write a routine that will take a pdf submitted by a user and extract each page as an image and then populate an array with those images i ve found several examples that append all pages to one image but none that do what i need this is what i have but it returns an empty array one of the caveats here is that i can t write these files to disk must use strings arrays i looked through the imagemagick manual and didn t find anything about outputting multiple images to an array only to a series of files saved to disk update i found a way to achieve what i need but it s ugly inefficient and i m sure slow but there didn t seem to be any other way produces an array named img array with the pages of the incoming pdf residing within keys of img array as strings of png image data there must be a better way why won t nextimage work why can t i use setiteratorindex without reinitializing creating new imagick objects each time i must be missing something but there are gaping holes in the documentation and google the imagemagick forums nor stackoverflow know anything about this being done successfully tested extremely slow a page simple pdf takes almost a minute update after finishing the larger project that this code bit went into i decided to return to a few points and improve upon the performance this is what i came up with this change resulted in a page complex pdf conversion going from seconds down to about seconds i understand why some of the changes helped not so clear on the others hopefully someone will find this useful update figured out why performance went up so much moving setresolution to below readimageblob causes the dpi setting to be ignored which defaults to in note of this i moved the declaration back and reduced it to and achieved similar results but still much better performance see notes on php net here

log j extra logging arguments i m developing a internal library where i want to enforce that developers using this lihrary include a text id when logging error or fatal level messages without modifying log j what we want to enforce is similar to logger error e an error has occured with none or minor extension to log j we could either during nightly builds scan the source code to verify that the text id is included or implement a log j appender that verifies it during runtime what we would like however is to add an extra argument to the error method e g logger error e an error has occured this could be handled by implementing some facade class for the log j logger class have anyone else had similar issue what was your solution for now we prefer the first code example in the future we might implement the code analyzer to execute during nightly builds or do anyone know about some existing code analyzer that can be configured to detect a missing text id from an error method call

directx disable the depth buffer this question relates to a previous question i have asked i have a series of textures on flat square meshes that i am rendering and they all combine to form one scene they each have a large percentage of of transparency with one or two smaller images and when they are line up i should be able to see the full scene i expected this would work without much issue but when when i went to test it i see the top most texture and then anywhere it would have transparency it is just the clear color at first i thought it was an issue with how i was loading the image and somehow was disabling the alpha but after playing around with the clear color i realized that there was some transparency second i tried was to enable blending this works if all the textures get combined on a single z plane i have posted my image loading and blending code on the question i linked to above now i am starting to think it may be an issue with the depth buffer so i added the following code to my window dependent resources even with this code i am only seeing the topmost layer am i missing something or am i setting something incorrectly edit to visualize the problem it s as if i had panes of glass that are all the same size and they are all in a row each piece of glass has one image somewhere on it when you look through all the glass panes you get one extra awesome image of all the smaller images combined for me directx or the pixel shader is only drawing the first glass pane and filling all the transparency of the first pane with the clear background color edit the code i m using to create the depthstencilview that code is literally right above my depth test d d depth stencil desc code i m presuming that this creates the depth code

 only shows first char of selected option i have a standard select box which i m populating using jquery by appending options but for some reason ie only shows the first character of the selected option needless to say it works perfectly in firefox and chrome but i have to support ie i tried the ie compatibility modes but it made no difference nor does styling the select or option has anyone seen this issue before what caused it how did you fix it simplified code sample res result is a simple json array like this oh bugger it works fine in my simplified example so the problem is somewhere else sorry guys the original code is to long and complex to paste here but will let you guys know when i find the answer some time later ok guys i got the problem down to an ajax call inside a selector each loop the loop goes through all select boxes and asyncronously populates the options if i make it a syncronous call the select boxes have the correct width and show correctly but if its an async call the select boxes only show the first char as in the image still working on this will get back to you guys again i still want to know what would cause a select box to display incorrectly i can do workarounds and get it to show correctly but that doesn t answer the question it s just a select with options in it it should always just work right after a weekend of ignoring the issue right guys i found a workaround before doing the ajax call to populate the select box i first set the css display property to none on it then populate it and finally when the ajax call and population is complete i just remove the css display none property so i still don t know why ie doesn t like me but we have a solution at least

how do you estimate how much memory to buy i have a custom server application that runs on windows r it is a home grown windows service written in net supporting a number of custom terminals i have a test machine that has a similar specification to the live server and i have a set of client simulators that i can use to produce a load that is a reasonable approximation of the real system i need to be able to support of these and at present the server is running out of memory paging is going through the roof my plan was to only start of the simulators measure memory usage then start more measure memory again and repeat until paging starts going up in reality i will be taking more than three data points this should give me a figure for the amount of extra memory required for simulators and enable me to project how much memory is required i only need a rough idea gb to avoid buying the full tb worth that the server will take my question is whether this is a reasonable method to use and if so which performance counters would you monitor to give the amount of memory actually being used i am specifically talking about memory here as the difference between working set private bytes committed shared virtual and all the other memory terms confuse me i think i can manage to monitor cpu io and networking by myself the other thing i have noticed is that the net cache adjusts its memory usage depending upon what is available which makes spotting a trend hard to see

set jpeg metadata implementation problems through prior research i ve found that is isn t too hard to set the metadata properties on an image for example i can read a jpeg image into a bitmap object and change its original taken date through the image s setpropertyitem method i ve already researched the format and enumeration for doing this too however although the actual metadata part seems easy i am faced with a couple of irritating implementation issues when i call save on the bitmap it doesn t seem that the image s original encoding settings are used as a result the compression level changes presumably to some default value i can see the file size shrink considerably after my save call i know that you can customize the encoding settings for an image within the call to save but honestly i only want to change the picture s metadata isn t there any easy way to just save the image using its original encoding settings even if i could directly reference the image s existing encoding settings in the save call that would help apparently the original file is locked when you read it into a bitmap object as a result i can t save the image under its original file name without a lot of messing around currently i m drawing the image i read from file onto an offscreen bitmap disposing of the original image and then saving the offscreen bitmap again this seems like an awful lot of extra work when all i want to do is update the metadata in an image file any suggestions you can offer would be most appreciated the amount of work i m having to do just to update a jpeg file s meta data most of which has nothing to do with the actual metadata change leads me to wonder if i m missing some easier or better ways of doing this 
unit test a class that contains an idictionary i am creating a class that determines which of number of registered wcf client callbacks to call when a client registers with the server it supplies the token it is interested in the class then stores a mapping of token to iclientcallback interface for that token in a dictionary the method and it s class under test looks like the following how do i test the clients are successfully registered with the router i figured i can either assume that if the function returned true it is successful but what is to stop the function body being only return true or i could inject the clients dictionary into the constructor of the class and in my test i could check that clients count equals as per the following while the test above seems good it seems like overkill to use dependency injection to insert the collection in just so i can test it however it does make testing a lot easier and more accurate when testing other methods of the class too is this the recommended way to test this method or is it overkill

asynchronous job queue for web service in clojure at the moment i m trying to construct a web service with a restful api that handles some long running tasks jobs the idea is that a user submits a job by doing a post which returns some url for checking the job status which also contains a url for the results once the job is complete i e some value was written to a database the results url will return the appropriate information instead of no results and the job url will indicate a completed status unfortunately the calculations are quite intensive so only one can be run at a time therefore the jobs need to be queued in pseudo something like this would be needed i ve looked into lamina which allows asynchronous processing but it didn t seem to suit my needs my question is how to dequeue the jobs queue and execute its task after the previous one has finished without terminating when the queue is empty i e perpetually processing the incoming jobs

how to get rid of the double scroll bar problem when using an iframe i ve seen this problem on the web and all the suggested solutions aren t working for me so i thought i d come here i have a page that has an iframe the top of the page is a dropdown menu the rest of the page is the iframe the idea like i m sure everybody else does is to have the menu stay stationary and the menu selection runs an application in the iframe the contents of the iframe should scroll but the page as a whole should not i ve tried putting the iframe inside a single table element also with but i get two scrollbars if i make the window too short vertically any suggestions i think i didn t explain myself well i want to keep the scroll bar in the iframe as auto but i don t ever want a scroll bar for the whole page i need the iframe to size appropriately so it always takes up exactly the remainder of the page so the browser doesn t have to make a scroll bar because the iframe should never extend off the bottom of the viewing area

web developer interview questions i read an article today that listed some basic questions about web development describe how post data was submitted to a server by a browser explain a number of http status codes except maybe and explain solid or name a design pattern explain ways to improve a page load speed or user experience the author says if you can t answer the questions above there are a lot of people who wouldn t think of you as a senior web developer my questions are how relevant are these questions in respect to real life web programming and scalability how true is that statement in other words do you consider this knowledge a requirement to be considered a senior web developer i was able to answer all the questions too easily it seemed so i m wondering whether it is effective to use these or similar questions to screen developers rather than asking them to write sample code

is it possible to catch an object not initialized exception in dynamics ax problem i have some code that is failing because an object has not been initialized the solution for this bug is easy to fix when detected however what surprised me is that my elaborate exception handling didn t catch this exception that meant the exception wasn t logged or handled and code following the try catch block was never executed the try catch block was outside of the transaction so there was no issue there in this particular case the exception was inside a batch runbasebatch job the job handled several unrelated processing tasks once the exception conditions were met the job terminated so the other unrelated processing tasks were never called does anyone know if it is possible to catch an object not initialized exception in dynamics ax i read one post that said it may not be possible to catch certain exceptions in ax however i hope that is not the case reference https community dynamics com product ax f p aspx code example here is some simplistic code that recreates the issue update i am waiting to accept an answer until this question has been viewed more thank you for the answers so far i know the example i gave was simplistic this type of bug is easily fixable when it is known and defensive programming is always a good idea however in the real world the code where the bug occurred was very complex the error occurred several levels deep in an overloaded method of a subclass it occurred in a specific scenario when an overloaded method corrupted the protected value of a member variable from the super class that is where the bug occurred in the code however it didn t manifest itself until the super class tried to use the member variable again the bug was summarily fixed when it was detected and tracked down defensively yes you could check every protected member variable every time you use it but that does start to impact performance code readability practicality etc which is why languages offer exception handling the question here is how can these type of bugs be caught to make code more robust and bullet proof in most development environments c c c or java for example a try catch at a top level could be used to catch log and clean up all unexpected exceptions so the code would be able to continue processing with the other unrelated tasks ax is continuing at some level because the whole system doesn t come to a grinding halt when this bug occurs however the code after the catch in this job is not executing because of what appears to be a deficiency in ax x i am looking for an innovative solution or work around if it exists to catch the object not initialized exception really all exceptions and to continue processing

does a message authentication code mac ensure authenticity of the key used i have to protects confidentiality integrity and authenticity of a file of records with a password the number of records can potentially be more then and each record can be accessed independently one way to implement it is generate a bit random salt and store it in the file header generate a derived key from the password and the salt using pbkdf with hmac sha from pkcs for each record generate a bit random initialization vector encrypt each record s content using aes in gcm mode using the derived key the initialization vector and as additional authenticated data the position of the record in a file as a result each record will store an initialization vector an encrypted content and a mac but the nist special publication sp d defining gcm and gmac requires the number of records to be less than for the initialization vectors to be unique so i devised another solution create a key for each record with hmac sha using the derived key as a key and the position of the record in a file as a message to be authenticated salt so the question is do i need to provide the position of the record in a file to the authenticated encryption algorithm as an additional authenticated data since i ve already taken care of it when generating the key additionally do i really need to use initialization vectors at all since all the records will be encrypted and authenticated using supposedly different keys generated by hmac sha pbkdf hmac sha password salt iterationcount blockaddress i don t know what the size of the file will be so i presume it can be very large

starting on orms nhibernate i am starting to delve into the realm of orms particularly nhibernate in developing net data aware applications i must say that the learning curve is pretty steep and that a lot of things should be noted apparently it actually changes the way you do data aware applications manner of coding development and just about everything anyway i want to ask if you do set some parameters when deciding to use or not to use orms in your applications how do you decide then the approach that one needs to make it valuable to your organization the organization which i work for now apparently has made a lot of sql and data access thing running through back end and i must say that these class methods procedures have successfully performed their tasks of providing the data which is needed and when it is needed i think it would be a tremendous effort just to map some of this into orm and derive the same business value that the company has for the last few years nevertheless i know that orm paves the way for applications to talk with database servers if properly implemented i must admit that i am at a learning stage and that i would possibly need all the help resources and the guidance to make this transition i was also thinking of buying the book from manning but i feel that with so much changes to nhibernate the book may be a bit outdated perhaps waiting for the packt book on nhibernate release on may would help me better get up and running kindly share your thoughts by the way if you could also point me in a small sample web app which uses nhibernate visual web developer express and sql server that would be highly appreciated thanks

why garbage collection if smart pointers are there these days so many languages are garbage collected it is even available for c by third parties but c has raii and smart pointers so what s the point of using garbage collection is it doing something extra and in other languages like c if all the references are treated as smart pointers keeping raii aside by specification and by implementation will there still be any need of garbage collectors if no then why is this not so

mpmovieplayercontroller freezes avcapturevideopreviewlayer i m building an app that shows a video preview layer using avcapturevideopreviewlayer the setup of that is pretty straight forward and it seems to work well later i have a situation where a user can exchange the view containing the preview layer with one that shows a view that contains a recorded video using mpmovieplayercontroller i set it up like so the previous code block comes from the uiviewcontroller s viewdidload method and this is in the same controller as part of its own method for changing the view the trouble is that when the mpmovieplayercontroller is added to the view the preview freezes it shows the last frame of whatever was in front of the camera prior to entering this code block i get no error messages and i can t find any source for the problem i do note that i m not releasing the player variable any attempts to do so break the player including autoreleasing it or trying to release it in a notification callback however i don t think that issue while potentially a problem in its own right is the source of killing my preview layer i would appreciate any insight you might have into this issue update boredastronaut asked below how i set up the views here i have one controller running all the views in my app i have the preview layer and in the same spot the view that contains the player all views are loaded in loadview and i use the hidden property to show hide these layers as appropriate

unit testing code with unpredictable external dependencies i am involved with a project which must among other things controlling various laboratory instruments robots readers etc most of these instruments are controlled either through dcom based drivers the serial port or by launching proprietary programs with various arguments some of these programs or drivers include simulation mode some don t obviously my development computer cannot be connected to all of the instruments and while i can fire up virtual machines for the instruments whose drivers include a simulation mode some stuff cannot be tested without the actual instrument now my own code is mostly not about the actual operations on the instruments but about starting operations making sure everything is fine and synchronising between the lot of them it is written in java using various libraries to interface with the instruments and their drivers i want to write unit tests for the various instrument control modules however because the instruments can fail in many ways some of which are documented some of which aren t because the code depends on these partially random outputs i am a bit lost regarding how to write unit tests for these parts of my code i have considered the following solutions only test with actual instruments connected possibly the most accurate method but it is not practical at all insert plate in reader run unit test remove plate run unit test etc not to mention potentially dangerous use a mock object to simulate the part that actually communicates with the thing while this one is definitely easier to implement and run it may not be able to reproduce the full range of potential failures as mentioned above a lot is undocumented which can sometimes cause bad surprises while i am currently thinking of going with the latter am i missing something is there a better way to do this

how to organize junit tests to separately cover packages and entire program this question is about your experience and industry best practices please comment on what i did and see whether it makes sence let me know how you handle the same problem when i write my tests i usually focus on on package at a time each class in src gets its own test class life is good for a given package i come up with a single class that is responsible for running all tests in a package for example that looks like this concern this introduces extra class that is used to run all tests for that package concern my tendency is to precede that class with an underscore to make sure it shows up on top understore i was told is a bad taste question is it common to create a separate test class to test a given package pattern as shown above repeats for every package i have for each package i have under test i have an package x tests java additionally at the root directory under test i have a mother of all tests class which includes all package tests concern i really would rather avoid default package but at the same time i like very much to see first test that shows up to be the master test file concern again i must have read this somewhere mastertests class starts with an underscore for consistency i gues how do you guys handle this is what i described an acceptable approach for me personally i am very attracked to the idea of having an option to run all tests and all package tests separately thanks and please let me know 
how to let the android os know my app has stuff to do when it is background i am designing an android app that needs to play a sound every minute while in its active state i have the logic that plays the sound every minute in the active state using a runnable and handler the app works fine if you press the start or stop buttons if you run the app and hit stop it kills the app if you run the app hit home the sounds continue to play and when you relaunch the timer will be up to date this is expected the problem i am having is that if you hit home and then launch another app there is a high chance my app gets killed and the sounds will no longer play and consequently gui will is reset when you relaunch my question is what approach should i use so that my app will continue to play the sounds until i tell it to stop even if its not in the foreground the sounds can be thought of as a reminder to the user i have tried using the google machine to help me out but am having no luck

how to stop a windows service that has multiple threads cannot be stopped i have a windows service written in c that creates multiple threads and some threads have legacy code and i don t have enough time access to legacy code to wait for all these threads to stop before onstop completes again at some point i dont have references to all threads as there are legacy codes now i want to update the service dynamically so i start a different updater service from my job service the updater service will stop the job service download job service exe and other dlls replace these with old service exe and dlls and finally would restart the job service upon start job service will stop the updater service now when the updater service stops the job service using servicecontroller stop and also calls servicecontroller waitforstatus servicecontrollerstatus stopped the job service stops but the some legacy threads spawned from job service may not stop at that moment and as a result the job service exe cannot be updated i really dont find any good solution yet the best solution could have been to use waithandles autoresetevent manualresetevent to wait for all threads to finish which is not happening or may be all threads could have been forcefully aborted which also seems critical another undesired solution could be to find all threads running in the service process and terminate abort all threads which is not straightforward and also not a preferable solution at all i was hopeful to use environment exit in onstop but found that it causes windows to show a bad alert message saying process terminated unexpectedly error which i have not been able to resolve at all now i am confused what should be done at this moment in a short time without touching the legacy code any help would be appreciable

what is the term that means keeping the arguments for different api calls as similar as possible there is a word which i can never remember it expresses a design goal that api calls or functions or methods or whatever should be as similar as reasonably possible in their argument patterns it may also extend to naming as well in other words all other things being equal it is probably bad to have these three functions if instead you could have what is the word for this concept i keep thinking it s orthogonal but it definitely isn t its a very important concept and to me it s one of the biggest things that makes some apis a joy to work with because once you learn a few things you can pretty much use everything without looking at doco and others a pain because every function is done inconsistently

how to emulate friend in c i need to implement a little bit of c style friend functionality in c and am looking for ideas consider two classes that are very closely related node and nodepart nodes contain nodeparts which are added via public addpart calls from other systems with parts that those systems construct node needs to reach into nodepart to do some very specific notifications that nodepart will distribute via separate virtual protected methods to any derived classes after some processing for anyone familiar with component based game object programming this is the same kind of thing i d like to be able to have nodepart give node a way to get at these few notification methods without letting any other types in the system do it it s not necessary for node to access any other nodepart internals just forward along some private notifications now putting these classes in an assembly and using internal would obviously do the trick but i m looking for a better pattern than that i m not really interested in spawning new assemblies for every set of classes i d like to do this with in the future aside from reflection invoke which is yucky and brittle what other patterns can you think of to solve this problem here my spidey senses tell me that interfaces are part of the solution but i can t think of how note i m ok with security through obscurity this system doesn t have to be proof against misuse just enough to discourage people from doing what they should not we re not building defibrillators here update lots of the below answers require multiple assemblies as i mention above i d really like avoid this i do not want to put one system per assembly we have enough of the things as is and i can t go down the il linking route due to our use of xaml but thanks for the answers anyway update i messed around in linqpad and came up with a few options based on the answers below which do you like worst least and why option obsolete not bad a little weird but the weirdness is very confined i m leaning towards this one because it s so much more compact than the next option option access hack hacka hacka hacka my original version didn t have the reflect invoke and would have relied on systemaccess being non obvious that might be ok too but i kind of like the bit of extra security i get here even though it s probably not necessary

uncaught typeerror property is not a function after page has loaded i m using a cross domain ajax request to an external api every so often it fails with the console message looking at the json being returned it is valid json so it is not the fault of the external api i can t reproduce the error reliably the only factor that seems to trigger the error is when i call the request quickly and repeatedly in this case i m calling the ajax request when the user moves a google map to add markers to the map and it occurs if the user moves around too quickly here are the relevant parts of my code having googled a bit the error generally seems to occur when jquery has not been loaded however i don t see that this is relevant here because the function is called from the map s tilesloaded event and it doesn t generally fire the first time it tends to fire after five or six rapid map resizes so if it works once the page surely can t have forgotten about jquery thanks for your advice

delaying emails in php to avoid exceeding server limit okay so here s my problem i have a list of members on a website and periodically one of the admins my site who are not very web or tech savvy will send a newsletter to the memberlist my current memberlist is well over individuals long so i wrote an email script that sends the email to the full memberlist with the members listed in the bcc header however i ve discovered that my host server has a limit of emails per hour which i apparently exceed even though the members are listed in the bcc field i wasn t previously aware that the behaviour of bcc was to send separate emails for each name on the list after some thought i ve come to the conclusion that my only solution is to have my script send only the email to only the first emails wait an hour and send a second email to the next three hundred wait another hour and so on until i ve sent the email to the whole member list looking around on the internet i ve seen some other solutions people have come up with for delaying emails in php sleep is obviously not an option because i can t just leave the script open and running for or four hours i ve seen some people suggest cron jobs but i m not sure how feasible it would be to create three new cron jobs every time i send an email use them once and then delete them afterward the final and what i think is the smartest solution i ve seen is to have a table in my database to temporarily store the emails to be delayed and sent later and then create a cron job that checks this sql table every hour or so compares the timestamp of the row to the current timestamp and then sends the email if an hour has passed so i m asking you all which method you would recommend is there an easier solution that i ve completely looked over aside from getting a different hosting plan ha or is there a cleaner way to do it than the database cron job approach tl dr i have emails to send in an hour on a server that limits me to hr using php find a way to get around this problem in a way that the person sending the email needs only to click send

comparing a saved movement with other movement with kinect i need to develop an application where a user physiotherapist will perform a movement in front of the kinect i ll write the data movement in the database and then the patient will try to imitate this motion the system will calculate the similarity between the movement recorded and executed my first idea is during recording each second by example to store the position x y z of the points and then compare them in the execution time by patient i know that this approach is too simple because i imagine that in people of different sizes the skeleton is recognized differently so the comparison is not reliable my question is about the best way to compare a saved motion with a movement executed on the fly ps sorry by my english 
spline representation with scipy interpolate poor interpolation for low amplitude rapidly oscillating functions i need to numerically calculate the first and second derivative of a function for which i ve attempted to use both and to create splines for the purpose of interpolation the function to take the derivatives however it seems that there s an inherent problem in the spline representation itself for functions who s magnitude is order or lower and are rapidly oscillating as an example consider the following code to create a spline representation of the sine function over the interval pi so the function oscillates three times only below are the results for m for a e and a e http i imgur com ueixq png amplitude http i imgur com zffk png amplitude clearly the interpolated function created by the splines is totally incorrect the nd graph does not even oscillate the correct frequency does anyone have any insight into this problem or know of another way to create splines within numpy scipy cheers rory

 password toolbar button not available in safari on snow leopard i use password and it s not an exaggeration to say that i depend on it to manage my passwords since installing snow leopard both at home and at work i switched over to password since password doesn t work in bit mode fwiw i understand that password is still in beta so some quirky behavior is to be expected it s the inconsistency that makes this strange though see on my macbook at work no problems at all the password toolbar button shows up every time and works great but on my macbook pro at home it used to be that the password toolbar button wouldn t appear in the safari toolbar it appeared in firefox just fine so i had to manually add it to the toolbar via view customize toolbar every time i launched safari when i quit safari the password toolbar button would be removed from the toolbar so i had to re add it every time i m not sure why this happened but i considered it a minor annoyance so i didn t worry about it too much but now i ve upgraded to the most recent password build and its toolbar button no longer even appears as an available button in the customize toolbar menu so i m stuck without password in safari but again still available consistently and works flawlessly in firefox what s the story how come it works on one mac but not the other how do i get my beloved password back

opencl weird bug with array addressing pointers i have this simple kernel for testing note this is running on a cpu and memory is probably on the host it results in this error glibc detected program malloc smallbin double linked list corrupted x a a i suspect somehow this is corrupting a part of the program since it s accessing host memory but as far i know all memory allocated correctly it is on the stack but stays in scope while running however if i do this it results in the answer which is correct since a is an array with an allocation to its self fixed the issue this is also fine resulting in it seems as though just accessing a without assigning to its self causes the problem does anyone know what s going on i m on linux with amd opencl drivers with an intel cpu but i have a amd card edit the code the buffer is created with condensed down there is other code between the array and buffer

audio looping with xna on windows phone while the sound is still playing i need a way to start stop a loop while the sound is still playing i ve found that the best way to play multiple sounds together is to use xna so i ve created a starting from my object who contains the audio clip now the problem is that i have a button which should change the state of this clip from looped to non looping and viceversa here s the problem it throws an exception sayning that the loop must be set before the first play so i thought that while switching from non looping to looped i could just wait for the sound to stop and then recreate the setting and make it start again this one works but there s some delay and this makes you lose your timing so it s quite useless what i m looking for is a way to set or unset the loop while playing the sound and without any kind of delay edit i tried using two one looped and one not and simply switch between them using the volume the problem is that the non looped one just stops after the first play so if i loop it for two times and then i put it to non loop status no sound is played because the non looped clip already ended suggestions

opening process with php and keeping it open between requests i have a computational terminal program that i need to interact with using a php webpage i can do this in java using getruntime exec and then creating pipes that read from and write to the process and the process will exist between requests but i am not sure if it can be done with php as i dont think proc open keeps the process alive during requests here is the flow of the webpage i am creating first the user will enter a command on the webpage which will be fed to a the terminal program that performs the computation and then the answer is returned to the user i will use ajax for the request so that the answer is returned without refreshing the page now my issue is that i need to interact with the same process on the next request rather than start a new one this is because the terminal program has state that is i can set variables in it like this so on my first ajax call to the program i pass and the output from the program that is returned to the user s browser is then on my next ajax request i pass and then the program should output which gets passed back to the users browser but it is my understanding the the proc open function does not maintain state between requests i understand that the process is closed when the server responds to the user s request is this correct and if so is there any way to do what i need to do using php

iphone how whether to include my existing private key in a new certificate short version is it necessary or even possible for me to generate a new distribution certificate based on my existing private key or is there no harm both for new apps and updates to existing apps on the app store to generate a new certificate with a new private key long version it seems to me that there is conflicting misleading information in the iphone developer program user guide regarding private keys and distribution certificate expiration on the one hand it says that you should guard your private key with your life and keep a copy of it so that you can use it on a new machine if you change developer machines my understanding was that somehow you must hold onto your one true private key i e the first one you generate for your company when requesting your first certificate and use it forever at least use it forever once you ve deployed an app with it to the app store on the other hand it tells you that distribution certificates expire after one year and you can simply request a new distribution certificate when you need one what would make sense to me would be if they followed that with a paragraph that started because it is critical for you to use your original private key when requesting your new certificate here is how you request a certificate that is created from a pre existing private key but there is no such paragraph and after searching i haven t heard of a way to do that there is this closely related post on stackoverflow http stackoverflow com questions lost private key for iphone distribution certificate what could be solutions the answers to that question seem to indicate that when a distribution certificate is lost or expired you can revoke it and create a new one and there is no affect on your apps currently on the app store and you can continue to publish new apps with your new certificate without apple saying hey you aren t the same company as before one key question left unanswered by that post is whether it s possible to update existing apps on the app store using a different cert key than the one the apps were previously published under but i have heard elsewhere that that s possible also so it boils down to is it misleading for apple to make it sound like your private key is really the thing that identifies an app as being from your company is it really just your app id plus your credentials for logging in to the development portal and itunesconnect that identify your company and your apps

remove repetitive hard coded loops and conditions in c i have a class that compares instances of the same objects and generates a list of their differences this is done by looping through the key collections and filling a set of other collections with a list of what has changed this may make more sense after viewing the code below this works and generates an object that lets me know what exactly has been added and removed between the old object and the new one my question concern is this it is really ugly with tons of loops and conditions is there a better way to store approach this without having to rely so heavily on endless groups of hard coded conditions the targeted framework is 
knapsack like algorithm here is a very interesting java problem i ve found before book printing was found the books were copied by certain people called writers the bookkeeper has a stack of n books that need to be copied for that purpose he has k writers each book can have a different number of pages and every writer can only take books from the top of the stack if he takes book then he can take book but not book or book the bookkeeper knows the number of pages each book has and he needs to share the books between the writers in order for the maximum number of pages a writer has to copy to be the minimum possible the pages of course can t be split for example you can t have a page book split into and for example if we have books with writers and the books pages accordingly then the optimal solution would be for the first writer to take the first books the second writer the next book and the rd the last two books so we would have st pages nd pages rd pages so the program is to write an algorithm which finds the optimal solution for sharing the pages between the writers so in the end of the program you have to show how many pages each one got this was in a programming contest years ago and i wanted to give it a try and what i ve found so far is that if you take the total number of pages of all the books and divide them by the number of writers you get in the example pages and then you try to give to each writer the continuous books from the stack that are closest to that number but that doesn t work well at all for large page numbers especially if the number of pages a book has exceeds the total number of pages divided by the number of writers so share your opinion and give tips and hints if you d like mathematical or whatever this is a very interesting algorithm to be found

boost asio with openssl can t read http headers i m attempting to write a simple http https proxy using boost asio http is working fine but i m having some issues with https for the record this is a local proxy anyway so here is an example of how a transaction works with my setup browser asks for google com i lie to the browser and tell it to go to browser socket connects to my local server on i attempt to read the headers so i can do a real host lookup and open a second upstream socket so i can simply forward out the requests this is where things fail immediately when i try to print out the headers of the incoming socket it appears that they are already encrypted by the browser making the request i thought at first that perhaps the jumbled console output was just that the headers were compressed but after some thorough testing this is not the case so i m wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction perhaps to some reading material where i can better understand what is happening here why are the headers immediately encrypted before the connection to the server my proxy even completes and has a chance to communicate with the client is it a temp key do i need to ignore the initial headers and send some command back telling the client what temporary key to use or not to compress encrypt at all thanks so much in advance for any help i ve been stuck on this for a while 
logging to innodb table or local file which one is faster i need to implement a simple logging mechanism for my web application i have two options available one is to put the logging records into a local file e g somewhere like tmp file log the other way is to use an innodb table located in a busy database which is write only and has no read operation involved the table is straight forward with two columns one is the primary id column which is auto incremented the other is the logging text of type text the logging will be called times per second means it does writes per second currently i do not have access to the production server to actually benchmark these two different ways in the real environment which one would be faster generally speaking and why personally i would perfer to go with the innodb way coz it simplifies my code a little bit and i believe there is a reason why most web applications encourage to turn off runtime file logging in production env however the innodb table does locate in a busy database will that degrade the logging performance and make it slower than file logging thanks

jquery ui draggable helper clone removes draggable from original i am using draggable with the following options i m applying draggable to the content of the nd tab of a jquery ui tab upon load the issue is only the first drag works fine when i don t drop the draggable into an acceptable droppable the pod reverts back but i can t do another drag no matter what the dragged pod loses its draggableness in attempting to apply a stop function to the draggable init put me on a path to needing to nest infinite draggable calls the full script since this fiddle works http jsfiddle net notbrain dycy i m definitely thinking it s related to the dynamic application of draggable when the tabs are loaded any pointers are greatly appreciated 
should php session be created before login or after successful login if php session is created before login there will be one session file created for each request to login page the problem is if user makes multiple requests to server through a script then those many session files will be created if user wants to attack server he can send abnormally huge number of requests creating so many session files eating up all the temporary space and making the service unavailable i am not sure if this kind of attack is really possible feasible please share your comments on this and implications if php sessions is created before after successful login

bind thread execution to foreground service i want to perform some rather short tasks in a background thread however this tasks are very sensitive and must be as reliable as possible my first idea was to use a again short living foreground service i start the service do the tasks in a separate thread and stop it when they are finished sound simple similar to what robospice is doing however the documentation of service does not say anything about killing threads as service itself is just an object and not a thread how am i suppose to tell the system that a certain thread belongs to the service and should not be killed is it sufficient to just hold a reference to the thread object in my service object should i use a handlerthread and hold a reference to the looper like intentservice should i also extend the thread class and bind to the service hope someone can give me some directions thanks

cant retrieve discounted product price in custom script i have a custom script that outputs a list of particular products in csv format the frontend of the store just runs fine however when retrieving the price of a product in my script the actual finalprice does not take my catalog price rules into account which is kind of messed up since the method works perfectly in template files ect this is my code which i have drastically shortened for demonstration purposes this outputs the product s regular price but not the price accounted for the catalog price rule i have just applied all catalog rules again and have also rebuilt all indexes as i said the discount prices show fine in the frontend but for some reason i am not able to retrieve them in my script i hope someone has an idea what could be going wrong here thanks in advance 
dealing with multiple standards in single class library i m currently working on a project which will support multiple file writing specifications imagine if you had to support something like xml xml xml etc called adif currently there are two standards version and version and they are both used commercially and both still heavily used specification version incorporates much of version but there are some slight differences which rules out some inheritance and other oop tools how would you organize your project to support older versions yet continue to keep up with new standards namespaces standard version standard version standard version next version etc in a single class library seems sloppy separate class library for each in the same solution version dll version dll etc seems excessive etc i do intend to implement some code which will convert from one version to another basically i m looking for some advice on how to best organize this type of project http www adif org 
jsf lifecycle execute managed bean method after request complete using jsf and spring i use an managed bean this bean stores information about the logged in user it loads the user from the db in a method the logged in user can then trigger on action on the page that updates the user in database using another managed bean however the bean is constructed at the beginning of the request which is before the call to the updating action as a result when the page is redisplayed the variable still has its old values my question is do i have a way to run my loading method not at the beginning of the request but after the request has been sent or am i dealing with this in the wrong way thanks for your insight s bastien

where are doxygen comments appropriate necessary i don t have much experience with documentation tools like doxygen so i m not sure exactly how in code documentation should look should i write doxygen style comments for each member variable in a class or is this overkill if the variable names are fairly self explanatory should i include the comments from a header in the corresponding implementation file i m guessing no since anybody changing the comments in one file would have to make the same change in the other but it would certainly be convenient for developers working on the implementation not to have to consult the header file to know the purpose of a given method

performance overhead of standard containers and boost adap tv has chosen c to develop their software however they ve decided not to use the standard containers and boost for performance reasons as they ve blogged about it in the following article why we use c without using stl or boost it says emphasis mine there are several rules that we are obeying in order to keep the performance high avoid malloc calloc or new no free or delete and no need for tcmalloc no stl boost etc avoid locking as much as possible threads cpu cores hyperthread is a trade off between latency and throughput as we know the standard containers use allocators which uses and internally which are expensive operations so to avoid them adaptv has avoided using standard containers altogether instead of using and repeatedly they reuse memory which implies they use a memory pool i m wondering what s stopping them from using custom allocators for the standard containers the custom allocator could use a memory pool internally which means memory reuse so i don t see how standard containers would hurt performance or am i missing something can t we avoid using and with standard containers is there any other reason why would anyone avoid using standard containers or is it simply a lack of knowledge on their part which led to this decision and how about boost i suppose by stl they meant c standard containers not sgi s stl

the mechanics of extension via free functions or member functions loads of c libraries the standard included allow you to adapt your objects for use in the libraries the choice is often between a member function or a free function in the same namespace i d like to know mechanics and constructs the library code uses to dispatch a call which will call one of these extension functions i know this decision has to take place during compile time and involves templates the following runtime psuedocode is not possible non sense the reasons are out of the scope of this question the code above looks like runtime code so how does the library figure out the namespace a class is in how does it detect the three conditions what other pitfalls are there that need to be avoided the motivation for my question is for me to be able to find the dispatch blocks in libraries and to be able to use the constructs in my own code so detailed answers will help to win bounty ok so according to the answer from steve and the comments adl and sfinae are the key constructs for wiring up the dispatch at compile time i ve got my head arround adl primitively and sfinae again rudementary but i don t know how they orchistrate together in the way i think they should i want to see a illustrative example of how these two constructs can be put together so that a library can choose at compile time whether to call a user supplied member function in an object or a user supplied free function supplied in the same object s namespace this should only be done using the two constructs above no runtime dispatch of any sort lets say the object in question is called and this object needs to provide the behaviour of as a member function ofc if the behaviour is to be picked up from the object s namespace it will probably look like lets define the function that wants to dispatch where direction is an enum and v is a base class of

converting ntext to nvcharmax max getting around size limitation i m trying to change an existing sql ntext column to nvcharmax max and encountering an error on the size limit there s a large amount of existing data some of which is more than the k limit i believe we re looking to convert this so that the field is searchable in linq the x sql statements i ve tried are and the error i get is this is using sql server any help appreciated thanks update solution the marked answer below is correct and sql can change the column to the correct data type in my situation and there are no dramas with the linq utilising application we use on top of it i ve also been advised to follow it up with which completes the conversion by moving the data from the lob structure to the table if the length in less than k which improves performance keeps things proper

sheaf au sens de serre i learned the definition of sheaves from algebraic geometry by hartshorne while reading serre s gaga i was wondering if there was another definition of sheaves here is the link of the english translation of gaga my question originates from p n and i copy it down in the following let x be an variety over mathbb c and let x h be the analytic space associated to x if f is any sheaf on x we will equip the set f with a new topology which makes it into a sheaf on x h this topology is defined in the following manner if pi f to x denotes the projection from f to x one injects f into x h times f by the map f mapsto pi f f and the topology in question is that induced on f by that of x h times f one verifies immediately that one has equipped the set f with the structure of a sheaf on x h a sheaf which we denote by f for each x in x one then has f x f x the sheaves f and f only differ in their topologies f is nothing more than the inverse image of f under the continuous map x h to x my questions are is the definition of sheaf here same as that in hartshorne what s the meaning of pi f to x why f is the same as inverse image of f i understand this also as inverse image sheaf in the sense of hartshorne

how do i automatically empty the trash on logout users on a linux centos machine i administer consistently forget to empty the trash since the people work on big files this can fill up the home partition very quickly therefore i would like to create a script that automatically empties the user s trash whenever they log out how would i do that edit i guess i should clarify the situation a little the computer is attached to a microscope users come log on take pictures storing them on the generous scratch space during acquisition and then they transfer the data onto the server sometimes it happens that pictures that looked good at first glance are crap so the users delete the pictures which sends them to the trash in home instead of moving them to the server or they copy the data instead of moving and then they delete it later eventually they log off so that someone else can use the microscope if they just filled up home with their trash the next person cannot launch the acquisition program which means that i have to go empty the trash and since the microscope is used almost this may happen at rather inconvenient times in addition to possibly cancelling a microscopy session for the user to avoid these problems i want to make sure that the trash can is emptied whenever a user logs off so that the next user can get their work done

interop excel automation open workbook with a service account i am facing a situation here and would like some feedback or advice i have been given an application that run as a service with a specific service account not admin on the server and try to open an excel workbook the problem is not with the initial application as i can reproduce it with the generic c code below embedded in a service structure nothing special about this exapp and thisfilename which are just respectively casted to a microsoft office interop excel application and as a string with the path of the file to open log logger is a a logger class using log net to allow me seeing when the problem occurs the service is running as a service account which is a user on the server not an admin it has access to the target file and to files on the server as read access the server is a windows server standard edition sp could not try yet on a r server the problem i am facing is that it just hangs when trying to open the workbook so in terms of tracing the last line i have is opening workbook never reaching the workbook opened line no exception is raised so the code is very simple it is just trying to open an excel workbook i have done already some investigations and here are my findings i know that microsoft does not support a server side excel automation but i have been given the service as it and do not have a choice about the technology used i have configured all the component services dcom microsoft excel application security settings so that the service account has all the permissions possible the service does the job correctly if the service account is local admin on the machine this is not really on option for production the service does the job correctly if the file it tries to open is a local file unfortunately the file we tries to access is on a remote file server and it does not work in that situation the code above run from a command line with the same user on a remote file works fine but not any more when run as a service i have read about the c windows system config systemprofile desktop bug but the folder exists excel open correctly when lauched with the service account so basically the situation is the workbooks open method hangs when run as a service under a service account that is not admin and when accessing a remote file i would appreciate any input or idea on this topic thanks jonathan edit as per matt s workaround below we have implemented a local copy of the remote file so i am accepting it as an answer but i remain interested in any suggestion on how to make it work directly on the remote file

adsl modem router sometimes hands out incorrect ip addresses my setup is as follows main adsl modem router switch configured as dhcp server with address range the office machines are configured with fixed ip not in the same address pool of course and hard wired to this router a wireless access point router is connected to provide internet access for guests in a separate area this router is not configured as a dhcp server wireless authentication is turned off ip address lease times are set to hours sometimes guests are able to connect to the wireless access point but they are not given a valid ip they get x x x addresses rebooting their machines does not resolve the problem the only way to resolve is to reboot the main adsl router which is often frustrating for other users who are successfully connected with valid ip and dg the problem seems to occur more frequently to apple mac guests although it also sometimes occurs with win machines i personally use ubuntu on my laptop and thus far never have had any problem connecting and getting a valid ip address in the guest area one further point of note which may give a clue is that certain guests always apple mac get lease times of days however this does not stack out the number of available addresses and of course rebooting the router clears them until the next time they login

mean reverting random walks i need a set of stochastic processes x i t with the following characteristics at each time t the jump of each variable can be just s or s the processes have to be mean reverting so that in the limit t rightarrow infty the variance of the precess does not diverge for each time t sum i x i t sum i x i const or in other words the sum over all the increments sum i delta x i t has to be equal to zero my idea was to use something like x i t x i t s i t and s i t is equal to s with probability p i t and to s with probability p i t where p i t frac frac alpha left frac x i t m mid x i t m mid max i right where the max i is the maximum value taken over all the stochastic processes and m is the mean value around which the processes should oscillate i can then simulate the processes and impose manually the last of the three conditions now my question is how can i find analytic distribution of the random variable x i t i see from the simulation that as far as alpha is higher than zero the variance does not diverge anymore as t rightarrow infty is there a way to see it analytically is there anything similar in literature already developed thanks a lot for your help sam

efficient method for rendering cubes with different textures on each side for a minecraft like game i m trying to decide what the most efficient way to render a bunch of cubes with different textures in a minecraft like game is i discovered instanced rendering what i ve done is i ve created a single cube model which stores all the vertices normals and texture coordinates for a cube i create an array buffer out of that and pass it to the gpu once then i created a array of translation vector texture index structs and i use instanced rendering to redraw the same cube over and over each time translated and with the appropriate texture hopefully notch doesn t mind me using his textures until i make my own the problem is that not all sides will always have the same texture and i m trying to figure out how i can get them to be different for each block type the two solutions i ve come up with are use a different model for each block type this way i can specify different texture coordinates on each of the vertices i can still use instanced rendering but i d have do a separate pass for each block type pass texture indexes for each face instead of for every block the nd solution requires passing a lot more possibly redundant data i m not sure how great the benefits of instanced rendering are so i don t know if it would be better to do say up to passes for each block type or one big pass with all the data and render every block in one shot or perhaps there s another method i m not aware of

translating python regexp to shell i m writing an applescript playlist generator part of the process is to read the itunes library xml file to get a list of all of the genres in a user s library this is the python implementation which works as i d like the problem is i d like the applescript to be self contained and not require that this additional file be present i plan on making this available to other people and as far as i can tell applescript doesn t offer any type of regular expression capabilities out of the box i could loop over each track in the library to get all of the genres but this is a prohibitively long process that i already do once when building the playlist so i m looking for alternatives since applescript allows me to run a shell script and capture the results i imagine that i can accomplish the same behavior using some type of shell command be it grep perl or something else my nix command line skills are extremely rusty and i m looking for some guidance so in short i d like to find a way to translate the above python code into something i can call directly from the shell and get a similar result thanks

having trouble understanding and implementing the ford fulkerson algorithm i m trying to implement the ford fulkerson algorithm in java so far i have a graph with nodes and edges the nodes contains an id string and an adjacencylist of edges the edges contain the capacity and the node it leads to i m trying to understand the psudo code on the wikipedia page and how to implement it i m using java this is what i understand so far first i set the flow of all edges in the graph to zero what is a good way to represent flow directly in the edges of my graph as a variable the second step is to create the residual graph which is a network where the edges have the residual capacity capacity flow of the corresponding edges in the normal graph then you find a path from the source to the sink using this residual graph and find the minimal capacity along this path this is where stuff gets really tricky should i create an entirely new graph for the residual graph or should i represent it somehow in the original graph what is the best way step is repeated until no path can be found but every time it is found you do step and for each edge along the path you add the minimal value found in step for each edge in the opposite direction of the path you subtract the minimal value found in step step and puzzles me since i feel like it is the same thing to add in one direction as it is to substracting in the opposite these additions and substractions are made in the graph right not the residual graph would really appreciate some help i have been trying to wrap my head around this for a couple of hours now but i just can t seem to understand it

file backup scheme how to make effective backups i m the system administrator of a small law office employees which stores a large amount of important legal documents primarily pdfs excel spreadsheets and word documents on a simple windows xp computer which we call our server each user has full delete privileges a necessity to be able to work what is a good backup scheme for this sort of system i am going to run back up every night but the difficult question is what to do with moved and or deleted files do we delete them out of the back up do we update our back up to reflect the deletion but hang onto the deleted file just in case we need it in the future does anyone have an elegant solution to this problem the data being backed up is about gb ideally i d like a snapshot of the server for each day as the data is gb this is impossible to do in a direct fashion something that keeps a diff log from day to day and retains all data but lets me view the server exactly as it appeared on day x would be perfect edit well i ve done some more research and it sounds like what i m looking for is fairly common it s called either incremental or differential back up schemes and it looks like the best scheme is one that integrates both does anyone have a recommendation for a piece of software that will help me do this and can be scripted configured in a fairly flexible way in response to questions you must ask yourself which was linked to below how important or sensitive is the data on your systems very important moderately sensitive what type of information does the data contain text documents and scans of text documents excel spreadsheets how often does the data change a small amount of the data changes daily the rest rarely changes as new legal files are opened the data in those files change until the file is closed then it might never change again or just have a little added to it here and there can you supplement backups with shadow copies sure whatever is needed i can do how quickly do you need to recover the data speed of recovery isn t an issue a day would be fine do you have the equipment to perform backups right now we only have other office pcs if something is absolutely necessary it can likely be purchased who will be responsible for the backup and recovery plan me what s the best time to schedule backups after hours pm am do you need to store backups off site eventually having a good backup scheme in house will solve of problems

operators and constructor i have a class that that where i implemented my own constructor destructor copy constructor and copy assignment operator the class has a core set of members that i have in all of the the above and a set of state variables that i added as helpers for some of the methods these state variables are never just because i didn t bother doing it initialized in the constructor but are initialized before being used as such the copy constructor and copy assignment do nothing with them they just copy the members that i explicitly want can this be a problem what happens to members that aren t explicitly copied btw no pointers in these members they are also not initialized in the constructor can this lead to any hidden problems cheers andr

hide one element on my webpage when the user will print it the template of my website looks quite good when printed so i have no separate print css however there is one element at the top which is not needed when printed and about inches high so that s kind of a waste at the top of the printed page which imho distracts the user from the actual content so what i want to accomplish is hide that element div at the top of the page when a user prints the page but so far the only solution i ve seen is top create a separate css document which then will be used when the user will print my page that sounds good but do i now have to maintain different stylesheets with exact the same content besides that one div or is it possible to sort of override the standard stylesheet in the print stylesheet so i only have to define the exception for that one div in my print stylesheet hope this explains my problem 
object holding nsmutablearray has different content in parent child class i have thee classes hopbill hopbillcontroller and hopbillsheetcontroller hopbill creates an object holding a nsmutablearray for testing purposes i already add a row to the array in hopbill s method hopbillcontroller h has and the hopbillcontroller m initializes the object in it s method so far so good from hopbillcontroller m i can call methods to the ahopbill object it retrieves the row inserted on init etc hopbillsheetcontroller is a child of hopbillcontroller and is basically a sheet that pops up after pressing a button and after filling in some fields it needs to add a row to ahopbill en close the sheet in hopbillsheetcontroller i have i can all methods from hopbillsheetcontroller m to retrieve the row inserted on init all seems fine however when i fill in the fields in the sheet and press ok in order to add a row to ahopbill hopbillsheetcontroller calls a method in hopbillcontroller the row gets added but when i retrieve all rows from ahopbill in hopbillcontroller m it returns only the row inserted on ahopbill s init when i do the same from the sheet it returns the row inserted on ahopbill s init and the row i just added in the sheet it is as if i have two ahopbill objects but clearly this needs to be one single object what am i doing wrong

how to demonstrate java multithreading visibility problems if variables in java are accessed from multiple threads one must ensure that they are safely published this usually means using or i have got the impression that some of my colleagues do not take this issue seriously since they never heard of before and their programs have worked for years so my question is can someone provide an example java program snippet that reliably shows data visibility problems i think running a program and seeing the unexpected npe or stale variable value would help more than just theoretic explanations that cannot be demonstrated thanks a lot for your help update just to emphasis the point again i have read java concurreny in practice and know examples that theoretically have visibility issues what i am looking for is a way to actually demonstrate them i am not sure that this is actually possible but maybe there is a jvm configuration or something similar that allows it

can i temporarily suspend auto generated id in ormlite i am using android with ormlite in a small app i am currently writing the app aims to have a working import export function for which i use simple xml framework and everything works great up to a point the situation is as follows object a contains a foreign key referencing object b which references object c through a foreign key itself exporting a database is great importing works to with a small caveat namely that it works as long as the ids of all object are sequential and start from but if the database is fragmented i e i deleted a record here and there after i export the database i have holes in the generated xml structure example objects could be let s say i have a database with customers id and which hold respectively orders from through and through exporting this and then re importing in a clean database works great if however i delete customer and their orders and export it the exporter will write their id as they are i e and etc when i import the data into a fresh database i would first save the customer object via and then each of their orders via the problem is that the create function disregards the provided id which is not and the newly generated id for customer is in a fresh empty database same for the orders but since they reference customer with id the link between them is broken so after this somewhat long winded explanation here is my question is there a way to tell ormlite to take the provided value for a generatedid field and run with it instead of overwriting it i would be ok if any exception is generated in case the create function finds row already in the table with the same id but would proceed with saving the record otherwise i have thought of a work around for this all the objects should be sortable by id using the comparator interface sort the arraylist with objects to be imported for each object read supposed id into an int save to database using dao create if the object s new id is different than supposed id change it via dao updateid move to the next object in the list but that seems too cumbersome and error prone what if the create method tries to generate an id which you just re assigned to a previous object with updateid i don t believe my situation is so rare that no one has encountered this before i would appreciate a solution best regards todor

why doesn t this motionevent simulation work in one of the views in an exercise app am trying to perform text selection programmatically i am able to programmatically enter text selection mode which is visually indicated by cursorcontrollers aka handles on the top left corner of the view if i manually drag the right cursorcontroller then click it again in the emulator it works as expected perfectly showing a brief message text copied to clipboard but when i try to programmatically drag that right cursorcontroller nothing happens the way i try to do this is by simulating a motionevent in the view i call in the mainactivity i of course implement ontouchlistener if i understand correctly by mere returning false from ontouch android keeps looking for another ui object to consume the motionevent object eventually reaching my view why doesn t this happen i must be missing something very fundamental

most succinct way to determine if a variable equals a value from a list of values if i have a variable in c that needs to be checked to determine if it is equal to one of a set of variables what is the best way to do this i m not looking for a solution that stores the set in an array i m more curious to see if there is a solution that uses boolean logic in some way to get the answer i know i could do something like this i m curious to see if i could do something more like this obviously the above won t work but i m interested in seeing if there is something more succinct than my first example which has to repeat the same variable over and over again for each test value update i decided to accept coreyn s answer as it seems like the most simple approach it s practical and still simple for a novice to understand i think unfortunately where i work our system uses the net framework and there s no chance of upgrading any time soon are there any other solutions out there that don t rely on the net framework besides the most obvious one i can think of

google chrome domain authentication and clear text passwords in the http header in an answer to windows authentication with google chrome it is indicated that chrome does not yet support auto ntlm authentication which means that users authenticating to sites using windows authentication are prompted for a login which is annoying but not a problem where the problem resides is that the users password is then sent in clear text to the authenticating site i whipped up a quick asp net script that pulls the password out of the auth password in request servervariables collection both safari and opera prompt for user credentials but neither sends the password in clear text in the http header i find this especially odd since chrome like safari is based on webkit what is the difference between the way chrome authenticates in comparison to other browsers and why does it send the password to a site in this manner

handling many image files in scrollview on iphone similar to photos app so i ve seen this question asked before and in fact i asked it last night but i thought i d give it another go just to see if i could get any other unique views on the problem the problem i have an app with a large number of uiimageviews with image downloaded to disk in a scrollview which of course has two large problems facing it memory use and performance in my app memory use isn t so much a problem because i am employing techniques such as dequeuing and reusing imageviews and such but performance is another thing entirely right now as a memory saving procedure i only store image filepaths in memory because it would be ridiculous to store images in memory but the problem with this is that reading from the disk takes more time than from memory and slows down scrolling on the scrollview immensely so what kind of techniques do any of you suggest for something like this i ve seen three but don t want to use it because i need high customizability in my view and that just won t do image files are not large but just thumbnail size so there is no scaling or excess size there s got to be an intuitive way to handle this the built in photos app handles up to thousands of photos perfectly with low memory and slick and smooth scrolling performance

how to choose a salt for a hash function meant to protect passwords i m a near complete beginner and this is my first foray into encryption in fact this is probably the first time i use the word here is my question for a non banking military or even commercial web app what is the right way to choose a salt for a hash function used for passwords i can easily generate a pseudo random salt for each new user and append that salt to their pw before applying the hash function but i still need to store the salt so presumably anyone who gets access to the hashed passwords also gets the salts is the benefit of the salt simply to make the pw more random and therefore defeat the standard dictionary based rainbow tables would any of the following be good amp practical ideas store the salt in a separate db maybe a separate system definitely a different host name pw etc generate the salt based on a hash of a user name or first last name or sign up date presumably using a different hash function then the salt itself would not be stored in the db only the data used to compute it would store in the db a value which concatenates the hashed pw and the salt in a non obvious manner e g the salt is random keys and they are injected inside the hashed pw between letter numbers amp amp amp etc as a side question how easy is it to change a salted hash algorithm when upgrading the software of the website it feels nightmarish right now

how to share code as open source i have a little program that i wrote for a local group to handle a somewhat complicated scheduling issue for scheduling multiple meetings in multiple locations that change weekly according to certain criteria it s a niche need but i wouldn t be surprised if there are other groups that could use software like this in fact we ve had requests from others for directions on starting a group like this and if their groups get as big they might also want special software to help with scheduling i plan to continue developing the program and eventually make it an online web app but a very simple alpha version is completed as a console app i d like to make it available as open source but i have no idea what kind of process i should go through first right now all i have is java code not even unit tested thoroughly i haven t shown the code to anyone else there is no documentation i don t know where i would put the code so others could access it i don t know anything about licensing it i don t know what kind of support people will expect from me if i release it as open source i have no idea what else i should worry about can someone outline for me or post an article s that outlines the process of taking open source software from coded to completed available i really don t want to embarrass myself by doing things weirdly

best practice for volume control ios hardware volume control i m trying to understand what is best practice for apps that are mostly silent but occasionally produce sound such apps can take advantage of the side volume control on ios devices and avoid the need to design in a nsvolume control widget which i believe is not as convenient as the hardware side volume control the approach would apply to apps like mapquest mobile where you get occasional audio prompts that blend well with other music players using audio ducking but are silent for the most part i m wondering how others are addressing this same issue i have developed such a system that works rather nicely in my approach i query the audio apis to determine if other music is playing ipod aol radio pandora etc then start an audio session only if no other audio is playing this ties the hardware side volume control to the app instead of the ringer for iphones the challenge comes when you go to the background my approach kills deactivates the session in the background only if the app is not using audio if there is audio playing the session is deactivated at the conclusion of the playback the idea behind killing the playback is to restore the user s ability to adjust the ringer volume to their liking should my app continue to run in the background it is not as straight forward as it seems but my approach works for most cases still i am wondering if there are other more viable solutions to the problem what are other people doing would it make more sense to just include the volume control in a view that auto slides in out of place are there things that i have not considered how have you approached the problem do you have any general suggestions

tortoisesvn keeps stalling hanging i m reorganising my repository by using tortoisesvn to do move folders in my working copy to avoid having to re download the whole thing if i make the changes in the repo directly however the moving popup seems to just stay around for ever in many cases even when the dir being moved has few files the files seem to be moved ok except if i kill the process then i have to do svn cleanup every time i don t like killing processes working on my working copy but i can t find what s wrong my tortoise is pretty recent do i need to use tortoise of exactly the same version as the svn repo or anything weird like that one of the main problems is even when it is doing something the moving dialog doesn t indicate this it s supposed to show current progress but is usually totally out of sync or never updates at all edit i don t think it can be a connection problem the problems are all doing local svn move operations once i get those to work committing the changes to the remote server are just fine also tortoisesvn is killing my whole xp machine while it sits there the hard disk is thrashing and although task manager says my cpu usage is other apps simply stop responding such as chrome

creating webrequest post for twitter api using vb net there are quite a few twitter api related posts but none seem to answer my questions directly i know how to send an httpwebrequest as post i am fairly sure i need to send the webrequest to https api twitter com statuses update json not totally clear i know there are many libraries out there that all you have to do is pass your consumer keys and token keys however i need to create some very short code in a function that simple posts a hard coded string to twitter when i get this working that hard coded string will be replaced by variable i ve no need to status updates or any kind of information from twitter just post hello world to start with and i can go from there i am forced to use vb net i am using visual studio web developer now that all said i have looked at nikolas tarzia s vb net port of c sharp code here http oauth googlecode com svn code vbnet oauth vb i can see roughly what the functions do by looking at them but have no idea which ones i need to call to create a webresponse and send to twitter also i believe this code contains more than i need if i just want to create a post then likely i only need to hash function and the nonce function and my tokens and keys is that right if so could someone please help me narrow this down in the process helping me understand a bit better what properly formed webrequest needs to be sent to twitter to make a quick tweet thanks will ps i finally put together some code based on looking at oauth documentation a neat little code example on using post request in vb and the twitter developer area oauth tool to generate some base string for the request unfortunately while it compiles and runs okay i am not getting a tweet could someone have a look at the code and see if they can spot any glaring issues obviously i replaced my tokens and consumer keys with xxxxx all i want for christmas is to run this code and make a quick tweet on my twitter account

remapping home end from pc to mac via synergy is not client specific this question asks about the end key but the answers give no examples http superuser com questions what key works like end using a mac with synergy if they had i am guessing that they would likely have run into this problem adding lines like the bottom two of this to my synergy sgc in mydocuments on the winxp machine would work but causes the keys to stop functioning on the winxp machine unacceptable i next tried a compromise expecting that to broadcast the keystrokes to both machines regardless of which one was the active screen that and many other variations did not work what am i doing wrong has someone actually done this edit note that holding shift also prevents synergy from mapping the end key edit note that the above assumes that your synergy sgc also has something like the following

which cpu for xen lamp testbed budget dear serverfault knowledgeables im in a decision dilemma right now which i can t resolve due to lack of hands on experience i need to build a testbed for basically virtualizing a lamp application os ses not yet decided including server side calculations i ll opt for xen since it seems better supported by cloud hosters at the moment the hardware is for a proof of concept for a startup doing saas and might be used for closed live alpha beta later on after testing the testbed might be a deployed as a colocated white box server b used as workstation single socket is enough we want to have ecc memory for reliability this excludes most of the consumer line at intel if intel cpu then threaded cpu ht is preferred have at least gig ram if justified by price and reliability is not too bad a high quality desktop mb instead of a server mb would be worth a try it came down to the opteron vs the xeon for me after a lot of research but i don t necessarily have to be right which cpu is preferrable concerning tco mb price power requirements opteron or xeon which one offers better performance in real world applications do you have any other suggestions i probably overlooked thank you for your consideration

the science of installation i have minimal exposure to rpm windows installer mechanics and wix that said i m interested in making a cross platform installer tool linux windows that supports upgrading and downgrading versiona and patches of my own product i don t believe this is a topic to be approached lightly i would like to learn the science of the art or the art of the science if i succeed and build a minimally successful installer tool it would have these features does not depend on a platform specific tool such as windows installer reads xml or a declarative syntax to fulfill installation requirements attempts to minimize steps to upgrade or downgrade one of my products rather than requiring a complete uninstall and re install does not require knowledge of interim product versions in order to jump versions i e can upgrade one of my products from version to version without passing through version i m convinced that the key to achieving this goal is by seeing versions as a point a to point b problem which implies that a and b are described by two xml version documents that hold info about all the parts and actions files or platform specifics such as registry entries my installer tool would join or compare the two documents and determine a minimal set of changes to transform a into b to some extent i believe this is precisely what windows installer does of course there are further complexities but that is the point of this post where is the bible of information on this topic remember i want to make my own installer not use a platform specific one for those who care my products are usually written in c or c or perhaps i should study something like steam which is cross platform and has automated game updates as part of its capabilities in my case the problem of online deployment is already handled it is just the final installation step i m examining does steam use native installers such as an msi if yes then that is not what i m looking for in short what path should i pursue to become somewhat competent on the science of this topic

how to use machine names in wcf services with rest with windows authentication we are developing many wcf services that are hosted in iis iis running on windows server sp these services are set up for rest for an environment dev cert prod we typically have many services per iis server each service has its own login account that s assigned via the application pool this works fine but if we enable windows authentication on the virtual directory to allow user context passing not for impersonation or delegation we get security errors in specific cases if we connect to the service in c code using serviceendpoint it works however when we connect to the services via browser or non wcf code e g httpwebrequest java et al we get the security errors if i change the authentication in iis from negotiate ntlm to just ntlm then it works really what s happening is we re disabling kerberos and since these services talk to other servers in the network we start to get other issues where services can t connect to remote servers typically sql servers now here s the weird part if we give the machine a dns alias cname record and use the url with the alias it works e g we cannot give all these machines dns aliases that has been our solution to this point because we re starting to use vms extensively and spinning them up and down so we only have machine names we don t want to start scripting dns aliases on machine spin up now i know the spn issue however since we have multiple services hosted on the same website default website typically we can only create service principal name per server account since we host multiple services per server each mapped to its own account this isn t a solution another wrinkle we don t define endpoints in config files only in code here is the code to get a rest binding

javascript overlay not covering full page when div expands the page height i realize there s already been several questions like this but i think my case is a little different i have an div that i am absolutely positioning and floating on top of the page and i m setting an overlay behind it to grey out the rest of the page i have it working okay until you scroll up and down the page the problem is when the div appears it is still populating with ajax data so the height and width of the bg overlay has already been set but once all the data loads into the floating div it sometimes pushing the page down so the height increases so i can t calculate the height and width of the window or document because the floating div might not be fully loaded yet and once it does it pushes the screen down further causing the bg overlay to not cover the whole page so for example in the code it s going something like i verified this by adding an alert so that by the time i ve clicked the alert the bg overlay was able to calculate the true page size and it looks fine sorry if this sounds confusing but hopefully you get what i m trying to achieve i m assuming this isn t too difficult but i haven t been able to figure it out any help would be appreciated i m using jquery thanks 
what udp port number is most likely to be unblocked this question wasn t welcomed on stackoverflow nor serverfault so i m trying here in case superusers are more willing to hazard a guess for a custom udp server servicing a wide variety of client machines sending custom udp packets what s the best port to choose as the standard listening port for the server in that the port is not likely to be disabled at the client by a firewall or router my first inclination is to use port since almost everyone is using http but that s tcp and maybe blocking of udp on port has become common what s the best port to choose i m concerned the port i like say might be often blocked by overzealous admins setting routers firewalls to stop traffic on typically unused ports if most people don t block udp on then is a good choice if sites tend to block udp on ports that typically don t use udp then what s a better port because it s usually open for dns

can t add custom webhttpbehavior cannot add two items with the same key first a little bit of background i have a rest service in wcf that uses a webhttpendpoint rather than having explicit error handler in every service method or even every service class i d like to have a centralized error handling that does logging and is able to wrap a nice custom message to pass up to the client i am attempting to do this by implementing ierrorhandler and adding that with a customer webhttpbehavior then i m adding that using an extensionelement if the whole approach to error handling seems like a bad idea feel free to comment on that however my question is why i m getting this exception when the service tries to start it appears that either the webhttp or errorhandler behavior can exist by itself but they won t coexist

is haproxy able to pass ssl requests to apache mod ssl most of the documentation i ve read regarding haproxy and ssl seems to suggest that ssl must be handled before it reaches haproxy most solutions focus on using stunnel and a few suggest apache mod ssl infront of haproxy our problem though is that we use apache as a reverse proxy to a number of other sites which use their own certificates ideally what we d like is for haproxy to pass all ssl traffic to apache and let apache handle either the ssl or reverse proxying our current setup what i d like to do is it possible to do this is haproxy capable of forwarding ssl traffic to be handled by a server behind it

free software open source remote process execution and management system for linux i have the following requirements for a remote process execution management system and thought i d ask if anyone had seen something similar available under free software open source licensing terms before i write it myself runs on linux each machine in a cluster needs to have a local execution management daemon running as a system service that can do the following maintain a tcp connection with a client application initiated by the client start a child process with executable path command line arguments process environment and stdout stderr redirect to files in response to a command received from the client terminate a child process in response to a command received from the client report child process termination asynchronously to all connected clients report child process statistics cpu i o etc asynchronously to all connected clients this is an optional feature basically i have an environment in which long running processes need to be mixed with batch processes under control of a set of master server s that maintains the current global state configuration of managed processes running or not and load balances new processes asynchronous reporting of child process termination without polling is essential so ssh is not appropriate the master server will be fairly customized but i m hoping to find a daemon that can manage the activities on a single machine

concise way to minify xml using command line tools i have a bunch of xml files i m using for user interface and string translation in my project each of which have the following structure as part of my build process i d like to minify these files into a single xml file whereby each tag and all of its children are embedded within a tag the current solution i have is using grep to rip out the xml prolog opening messages tag and closing messages tag from each file and concatenating the result to a new file after concatenating the xml prolog and opening messages then finally concatenating the closing messages tag this solution is rather messy and error prone so how can i use any command line xml tools to automate this process could i use something like xmlpatterns and or xsl transforms side question how would i verify that each tag has an id attribute and that all id attribute values in the final document are unique i know i can do the first part by means of a dtd but is the second also in the realm of dtds or would i need to do something else

how to use in app billing with monodroid i am developing an android application that will need to make use of in app billing i am using monodroid in visual studio and my experience is in c i am not very familiar with java my questions are how do i reference the imarketbillingservice aidl in visual studio is it the same as in eclipse where you have to put it in the src com android vending billing folder also does it need to be a aidl file or can i just create a c interface class for it does anyone know of any android in app billing tutorials examples in c i have looked at the sample and have read all of the documentation here not having any experience in java makes it a little difficult to follow the sample i have searched everywhere and have not found any documentation on in app billing with monodroid so any help links would be much appreciated thanks edit one more question is it even possible to use in app billing with monodroid 
display an xml child element information based on its unique id i have an xml file that stores movies and their actors as you can see from the code above i have movie elements that contain actor child elements each movieid is unique and each actorid is unique within its corresponding movieid parent element this is my xslt code that displays actors names in a list from both movies all actors names are hyperlinked to actor details cfm page based on their corresponding actorid this is my actor details cfm code and this is my actor details xsl code when i click on any of the actors names displayed on the page it takes me to that specific actor details page that displays the actor s name and age the only problem i have is that there are two actors with id two actors with id and two actors with id located in movies so when i click on bob actorid it takes me to that specific actorid details page but instead of only displaying bob information name and age it also displays mike information the reason for that is because mike s details are also related to actorid except that it is located inside another movie element my program cannot distinguish the difference between the same actorid s located in separate movieid s it just displays all the information related to that specific id so no matter whether i click on bob or mike both have actorid the page displays the information for both bob and mike their names and ages this is what the actor details page displays this is what i want the actor details page to display so even though bob and mike have the same actorid s they are related to different movieid s and therefore i want to display their information separately

fixed function vs shaders help understand the conceptual differences my background i first started experimenting with opengl some months ago for no particular purpose just fun i started reading the opengl redbook and got as far as making a planetary system with a lot of different lighting that lasted for a month and my interest for opengl went away it awoke again a week or so ago and as i gathered from some so posts the redbook is outdated and the opengl superbible is a better source for learning so i started reading it i like the concept of shaders but there s a real mess going on in my brain because of transition from my old memories of the fixed pipeline and the new concept of shaders question i would like to write some statements which i think are true and i am asking opengl experts to verify them i e whether i am understanding correctly not quite correctly or absolutely incorrectly so if we don t use any shader program nothing changes we have current color current normal current transformation matrix current everything and as soon as we call these current values are taken and the vertex is fed to i don t know what the fact is that it s transformed with the current matrix the current color and normal are applied to it etc as soon as we use a shader program all the above stops working that is etc make no sense do they i mean still does set the current color still multiplies the current matrix by the rotation matrix but these aren t used at all instead we feed vertex attributes by which attribute means what is totally dependent on our vertex shader and the variable binding we also find ans set the values of the uniforms and then call and the shader is executed i don t know immediately or after glend is called the actual vertex and fragment processing is done entirely manually in the shader program shaders don t add anything to depth testing that is i don t need to take care of it in a shader i just call neither is face culling affected alpha blending and antialiasing need not be taken care of in shaders calls will suffice is it a good idea to use gluperspective glrotate glpushmatrix and other matrix functions and then retrieve the current matrix and feed it as a uniform to a shader thus there won t be any need in using a rd party matrix library

how can i make packaged apache work sanely on centos every time i ve ever run a production installation of apache it s been deployed in the standard configuration implied by the httpd documentation normally that dir structure is owned by root and i d go off and create a similar directory structure somewhere like the scripts in my dir then call through to those in passing it the option to point it at the conf files on thus i can run several instances of apache on the same server useful for e g having dev and uat environments on the same box always referring to a pristine copy of binaries that the application account can t modify if i need to listen on port a one time configuration by sets up rules that forward port to whatever port the relevant apache instance is listening on for bonus points in the above path is a symlink as is when required and the whole lot start scripts config and all is built out of source control and deployed with scripts so now i find myself with a centos vps account with apache pre installed it s been done through yum and the apache files are all over the place code in config in the doc base in all owned by root all offering in my mind very little flexibility i m en route to getting everything up in the manner that i m used to without compiling from source since i quite like the idea of being able to apply security updates with a single command but i have a couple of questions why do distros all the others i ve looked at seem to do the same insist on spewing the various bits of httpd all over the place why not just install under or similar how do other people make this work are people who aren t hosting companies really out there running apache out of specifically how do you get around being owned by symlinks how do you control apache upgrades clarifying a bit there s only one copy of the httpd binary on the sytem so when you upgrade you re essentially saying to all users apps on the system congrats you ve been upgraded shortly followed by what do you mean your config doesn t work any more how do you roll back apache upgrades if it all goes wrong in the past i ve struggled to make downgrade stuff thankfully that netbook came with a restore disk how do you version your apache config what s this dir bash cat etc httpd conf d readme this directory holds apache module specific configuration files any files in this directory which have the conf extension will be processed as apache configuration files files are processed in alphabetical order so if using configuration directives which depend on say mod perl being loaded ensure that these are placed in a filename later in the sort order than perl conf that s some sort of bad practical joke on unsuspecting noobs right

can i precisely time overlapped readfileex operations i m reading sector aligned chunks from a file using readfileex opened with createfile and the file flag no buffering flag recording a start time before the call and an end time in the completion routine times from queryperformancecounter the size of my chunk reads is constant regardless of the size of the overall file chunk offsets are queued sequentially so readfileex is always reading a point further in the file than the last one i m noticing some strange behaviour such that a smaller file records a significantly quicker chunk read time than a larger file in this case the size of the larger file is double that of the smaller one i shouldn t expect this to matter at the raw data reading level as i m reading the same size chunks regardless what i m seeing is the smaller file reporting mb s read and the larger file reporting mb s i am still working on the assumption that it s something else in my code causing the problem i also expect the read operations to begin at some operating system defined point after readfileex getlasterror returns error io pending edit my timing inaccuracy has been further confirmed by tweaking my read thread so it has more time to wait in an alertable state for the completionhandler notifications this increased the reported read speed indicating that part of my problem is that the completion handler does not get called immediately after the read is completed and so my end time is later than it should be however doing this increased the reported speed proportionally for both the larger and smaller file tl dr my question is can i measure the actual time of the read operation and not the time between calling readfileex which may not start the read straight away and the completion routine

should i use super fine or fine quality setting on samsung s camera i have a samsung s camera there are three quality settings super fine fine and normal which i believe relates to the jpeg compression level i have mainly used fine in the past but wonder if i should be using super fine instead all images are taken at the maximum supported resolution megapixels as a test i tried taking an almost identical photo in both modes super fine and fine to compare i found that there was no noticeable difference when looking normally at the photo on my monitor between the super fine and fine in this case however when i compared both images with faststone image viewer and zoomed up to the pixel level i may notice slightly more dithering around objects but it is very subtle the super fine photo was mb in size whereas the fine was only mb so is it worth nearly doubling file size by upping the quality setting i like to be able to archive my photos onto dvd r so smaller file size is an advantage 
algorithm to detect and compare phrases i have a couple of non english texts i would like to perform stylistic comparisons on them one method of comparing style is to look for similar phrases if i find in one book fishing skiing and hiking a couple of times and in another book fishing hiking and skiing the similarity in style points to one author i need to also be able to find fishing and even skiing or hiking though ideally i would also find angling hiking and skiing but because they are non english texts koine greek synonyms are harder to allow for and this aspect is not vital what is the best way to go about detecting these sorts of phrases and then searching for them in a way that is not overly rigid in other texts so as to find fishing and even skiing or hiking

analogy between etale sites and riemann surfaces i recently read that grothendieck originally introduced the etale site of a scheme as an analog of the formation of riemann surfaces over the complex numbers the salient point being that the latter is the proper setting in which to consider multi valued functions however morphisms of riemann surfaces generally have ramification points and so in particular they aren t etale on the other hand if we know that a morphism of riemann surfaces is a ramified cover then its restriction to the unramified locus uniquely determines the full ramified covering so my questions are should this additional fact be taken as part of the analogy that is does importing the theory of riemann surfaces really mean importing the theory of unramified maps of possibly punctured riemann surfaces is the analogous fact true for schemes i e something along the lines of an etale cover of the complement of a closed set perhaps satisfying certain properties extends uniquely to a ramified covering of course i suppose a positive answer to would make irrelevant for riemann surfaces i think this should just be that the covering has finitely many sheets

drawbacks with embedding event handlers in methods sometimes when i use assemblies that have an asynchronous approach for interaction you call a method and then you get an event back with the answer i like to convert them to synchrounus methods by embedding the event handler in the method the question is i don t see this kind of code any where else so i m getting a nasty feeling that there is some major drawback with this approach that i have missed and that everybody else is seeing so what do you think is it ok to write code like this simple example of logon method that embedds the event handler for the connection event i also think that this type of code even if the actual method can become a little bit complex can help in keeping a class that encapsulates a object with a lot of events clean and easy to read

in app purchase on iphone how to receive your available products before someone may be able to buy it currently i am loading my supported products from a plist and after that i send a skproductsrequest to guarantee that my skproducts are still valid so i set up the request start it and get the response in void productsrequest skproductsrequest request didreceiveresponse skproductsresponse response now so far all functions correctly problem from calling the request until receiving the response it may last several seconds until that my app is already loaded and the user may be able to choose and buy a product but because no products have been received the available products are not in sync with the validated products unlikely but possible error so my idea is to wait until the data is loaded and only continue when the list is validated just a few seconds waiting i have a singleton instance managing all products problem the app freezes everything works fine if didreceiveresponse is completed before the sharedinstance is queried there are different threads the lock is working if wait is reached during didreceiveresponse everything fine but if not didreceiveresponse is never called even if the request was sent the lock is released everything looks ok i have tried to send the product request in a separate nsthread with nsoperationqueue without avail why what is happening how to solve the problem 
osstatus error paramerr on audiounitrender call on device i m writing an ios app that captures audio from the microphone filters it with a high pass filter and plays it back through the speakers i m getting a osstatus error when i call on the render callback function when i run it on an iphone s but it runs fine on the simulator i m using an which has a unit a effect unit and an unit to make the asbds between the hpf and the output match the converter instance is called here s the code i think error means one of the parameters is wrong the only parameters that can be wrong are and given that all the rest are handed to me as arguments i ve checked the converterunit instance and it is correctly allocated and initialized what s more if that was the problem it wouldn t run on the simulator either the only parameter left to check is the what i could make out so far from debugging is that both the remoteio s output element s input asbd and the are different in the phone and on the simulator but still i think that to me that doesn t change things given that i create and allocate memory for the based on an asbd resulting from a call any help will be much appreciated i m kind of running desperate here you guys rock cheers update here s the audio controller class definition and here s the initialization code for the augraph defined in the reason i make the connection between the converter s output and the remote io unit s output element s input with a render callback function rather than with the method is because i need to make some calculations on the samples right after they ve been processed by the high pass filter the render callback gives me the opportunity to look into the samples buffer right after the call and do said calculations there update by debugging i found differences in the remote io output bus input asbd on the device and on the simulator it shouldn t make a difference i allocate and initialize the audiobufferlist based on data coming from a previous call but it s the only thing i can see different in the device and the simulator here s the remote io output bus input asbd on the device and here it is on the simulator

move data from staging tables to live tables while maintaining one to many relationship i have a database structure that has two one to many relationships i have a website which has many subjects each of which has many questions this results in three database tables one for each of these types of data what i am in the process of doing is implementing a staging area somewhere where i can make changes to these websites without affecting the live site so i ve duplicated the table structure with the intent of editing the duplicates and pushing changes to the live version when the changes are ready i would like to do this push in one stored procedure but i can t figure out how to maintain the relationship between the subjects and their questions the website has identifying features other than its id so it s easy enough to find the live version of the site and update its information and even to transfer that website s subjects from the staging tables to the live tables here is some pseudocode for what my plan is for the push note that subjects and questions may be added or removed in addition to being edited thus deleting and reinserting seems the best course of action i ve been able to write actual code for most of this as it s relatively simple but figuring out how to maintain the relationship between the subjects and the questions has been a problem if i were doing this in a server side scripting language i would do something like this again pseudocode as i said i d like to keep this all in the same stored procedure if this is not possible then i ll obviously go for the above version but for efficiency s sake i d rather not have several database hits

is there a respected antivirus and software firewall app that doesn t invade your privacy i recently purchased eset s av and firewall software suite i know it to be a respected app but when reading the license while installing they made it clear that they will collect not only information about infections on your machine but all of your installed software and settings they then go on to vaguely promise to keep it as reasonably private as possible i am not the paranoid type but i really don t think it s their business to require this information it should be an option i m also not exactly thrilled about the company being outside the us which means if they did violate my privacy in any intentional way i would have limited recourse is there a product as good as theirs that respects your privacy 
iis missing new web site option i ve got iis running on my machine with one web site default web site containing a few virtual directories i ve got one virtual directory running an asp net site and it s working fine i tried to set up another virtual directory to run a classic asp site but i guess you re not supposed to be able to do that so i was going to set up a separate web site to run it under but i can t find the option to do this i looked around online and it appears that i should have an option when i right click on the web sites folder to create a new web site but this is absent the only options in that context menu are refresh properties and menu i can t find the new web site option anywhere does anyone know why this might be thanks edit the issue was i didn t have ntfs permissions set for the website s directory so it was giving me a no access error i thought this was to do with iis as apparently sometimes incorrect settings in iis can cause this error apparently not 
merging vcproj files scm s hell merging project solution files is a well known disaster among developers scm admins performing merges in their source control take for example a common scenario development is done on a project solution in two different branches when time comes to merge back into a main development line there is a very small resemblance between the vcproj s and slns the reason is visual studio may change and does change location of the various xml like elements within these files e g configurations debug and release may swap order upon every save operation on the proj file this makes it impossible to easily incorporate changes from each development branch not even considering an automatic merge i can assume that microsoft are using some perl hashing system to hold the vcproj structures hence the rendering of the files upon a save operation is not ordered i d first like to ask did anyone found some elegant method to workaround this second i d like to make two suggestions have microsoft please reimplement the above files and restrict them to some rigid ordering of elements find a tool or write one that sorts vcproj xml format and sln sln format files alphabetically recursively all elements within elements etc using this tool on both source and target files would enable to easily point and merge the changes hoping that visual studio reads the sorted merged project or sln file any other ideas and thoughts are welcome

why doesnt my orthogonal projection matrix work i am trying to render some quads that are located in the plane z with an orthogonal projection i did set up a projection matrix after reading formula for a orthogonal projection matrix but i think i did something wrong my first attempt was the following matrix w and h are the width and height of my desired viewport which is x in the following examples here is what i obtained when i rendered a quad whose topleft corner was in since it was flipped vertically i changed my matrix to i obtained then i tried to move my quad around and the results were unexpected i wanted the x and y of the d space to match those of the viewport however here is what happened when i moved the quad along the x axis moving along the y axis gave equally unexpected results how can i fix my matrix so that the x and y axis of the d space match those of the viewport many thanks in advance 
scrapy how do i stop all spiders and the engine immediately after a condition in a pipeline is met we have a system written with scrapy to crawl a few websites there are several spiders and a few cascaded pipelines for all items passed by all crawlers one of the pipeline components queries the google servers for geocoding addresses google imposes a limit of requests per day per ip address and threatens to ban an ip address if it continues querying google even after google has responded with a warning message over query limit hence i want to know about any mechanism which i can invoke from within the pipeline that will completely and immediately stop all further crawling processing of all spiders and also the main engine i have checked other similar questions and their answers have not worked force my scrapy spider to stop crawling this does not work as it takes time for the spider to stop execution and hence many more requests are made to google which could potentially ban my ip address this one doesn t work at all items keep getting generated and passed to the pipeline although the log vomits sys exit exceptions systemexit raised to no effect how can i make scrapy crawl break and exit when encountering the first exception this one has the same problem as the first case mentioned above i tried to no avail edit if i do in the pipeline from scrapy contrib closespider import closespider what should i pass as the crawler argument to the closespider s init from the scope of my pipeline

make exim send bounces to postmaster instead of the sender for non local sender i have a few e mail aliases that forward to external hosts currently if the external host rejects a message exim generates a bounce message and sends it to the original sender this is bad because if the external host rejects the message as spam a common case then i m a source of backscatter spam thus if the sender is non local i d like to send the bounce to postmaster me instead alternately sending all bounces to postmaster would be good enough the exim documentation hints that this can be done when a message fails to be delivered exim sends a message to the original sender or to an alternative configured address emphasis added but i couldn t find how for example here is a log excerpt showing a backscatter spam being created in this case the purported source server isn t accepting connections is the purported sender of a spam e mail to which then forwards to gmail then rejects the message and my server creates a bounce to i want that bounce to go to instead usernames obfuscated the rest of the log is verbatim here is the relevant router

typedef with template functions say i have a template function in namespace a i also have another namespace b there is a template function declared in namespace a which is defined as now in namespace b i would want to declare a specialized type of the template function i was thinking if i could the template function so it is declared in namespace b as without actually implementing the function calling the template function as there is a way to declare new typenames with specific template parameters shouldn t there be a way to do that with functions aswell i tried different methods to achieve it but it didn t quite work out so is there already a way in c to redeclare the function with given template parameters without actually implementing a new function if not is it somehow achievable in c it would be a neat feature to have since it would make the purpose of the function more clear and would be syntactically better edit so one could write in b namespace and the function would show up with those template parameters

how to modify color conditioning cells in excel with vba is there a way to change over color condition cells i need to modify the font color and style i am pretty new to vba but i m sure it can be done faster than highlighting the entire sheet and modifying each rule one by one i do know that i can do the manage rules but i have over cells with an average of cells conditioned to one cell in other works cells a through d are test scores these scores need to be changed to green if the score is more than or equal to the minimum passing score if a passgrade then set color to green i know there is an easier way than setting it manually for now i have to change the individual cells accordingly some with duplicate upon duplicate upon duplicate etc rules one set of cells took minutes just to delete all the excess rules lesson learned just use the delete all conditions when that happens is there a simple code that can reference the cells objects in excel to speed this condition up i m using excel hope that makes things clearer thanks

sql query to eliminate similar entries i am working on a problem in sql server i have a table with six columns the table contains around a million recrods it s probably worth noting that value in column n value in column n i e i am trying to eliminate all rows which have digits in common ignoring the pk i e in this case the algorithm should start at the first row and delete the second and third rows because they contain matching digits the first row persists i have tried to brute force the solution but finding all the duplicates for only the first record takes upwards of seconds meaning processing the whole table would take way too long this should be a repeatable process i am fairly new to sql but this is what i have come up with i have come up with a few solutions but none were adequate this is the latest attempt i won t include all the code but i will explain the method i can paste more if it helps save the digits of record n into variables select all records which have one digit in common with record n from largetable insert all selected digits into onematch and include matchingone with the digit that matched select all records which have one digit in common with record n from the temp table where digit in common matching insert all selected digits into twomatch and include matchingone and matchingtwo repeat until inserting into fivematch delete fivematch from largetable and move to record n i am having a problem implementing this solution how can i assign the matching variable depending on the where clause i am able to fake the above using six queries but that is too inefficient sorry for the long description any help would be greatly appreciated new solution or implementation of my attempt above as this problem has been nagging at me for a while

subversion in multiuser environment with xcode i have been using xcode with subversion for some time now no problem was caused when i was using it as a single developer i was using commands only commit and add but now i have to share the code with another developer who has never used any kind of version control and integrating merging the code has become a nightmare no problem occur when we are integrating merging files but as soon as it comes to and files we really don t know what to do whenever we try to merge project was getting corrupt and merging was kind of impossible for us so i was wondering if someone can share his her experience on how to effectively use subversion git mercurial with xcode in multiuser environment or share a link which can explain how to use subversion effectively in multiuser environment thanks

conceptual question regarding application scope i m rather new to spring and i was just wondering if someone would be able to clear something up for me what i am wondering is what is the scope of a spring mvc web application do users get a new instance of the application whenever they use it or is it like a singleton where everyone gets the same instance of the application for example if i am storing some data in a controller that user had accessed and user comes along and starts using the web application will user see user s data or are they entirely separate instances i have tried to find an answer to this but with no luck i have read about the different bean states within an application but haven t found anything about the application itself any insight is greatly appreciated harleyq

zshrc command not found npm so i m looking into learning node js i ve been following this tutorial to install it and try some stuff out at any rate npm is behaving really strangely it ll work just fine for a while i changed its viewer config settings for instance but then suddenly disappear so that the next time i enter in the command line my shell informs me that the npm command has not been found previously uninstalling and then reinstalling npm using nvm has worked but i d rather not do this every ten minutes and it s super weird to me that it will suddenly stop working i think the last time it stopped working after i edited and then re sourced my zshrc file just added npm and node tab completion plugins any idea what s going on i ll post the results of a couple basic commands but i m really bad with sysadmin stuff and i don t really know what to look for here nvm ls which node which npm there s are both nvm is this a duplicate and npm directories directly in my root folder if i go into usr bin node is a file not a directory there s also a file npm but not file nvm as all the above probably shows i really have no idea what s going on i ve searched for this but nobody seems to have this problem any ideas what s going on or how to find out edit noticing that my default node isn t up to date i did all this putting aside why my shell switched me automatically to the bin directory and why that seems to be a github repo no idea what s up with my computer does this provide any clues edit i made sure the node path was added to my zshrc file but when i then tried to run i got this complaint which points to these lines numbers added which i got from following the above tut and back when npm was working looking up how to implement tab completion in response to jens this is in my nvm nvm sh file near the start i tried to and i think successfully did chmod the npm directory to make it read write executable 
checking value of array against array inside function c i am new to c and i am surei am writing a program that moves files if they meet a certain time criteria due to limitations of an existing rd party program the program works in its current capacity however i want to have it check for files with the same name in the destination and change the name of the file that is being moved so the program does not error out if there are already existing files with the same name also some fname and target are declared in the custom class glodir and are used in other functions as well this works but does not check for files in the target to check for files in the target i changed it to add a if statement that checks the directory for any files then a nested foreach loop that compares the values and that also works the only issues is when trying to use the string declard within the loop or if statement i copied the code with the addition below i also left in some of the console writes and sleeps that allow me to watch the program function those will not be in the final code every time it stops and says that the newfilename variable does not exist in the current context even though it should be created based on the conditions of the destination directory do i need to delcare the string newfilename differently so that it can be seen outside of the if statement and loop i am sure this is a simple mistake or one that i have not learned yet this may also be an issue with variable scope but i would not think so considering the other variable is also a string once again i am new to c and any help is appreciated

grow a div to the left is this even possible the basic setup is a sidebar on the right with div elements in it clicking one of these elements would add a popout div that should be displayed left of the clicked element the popout contains a variable number of buttons i d like to style it using only css so i can just add the correct html elements from my script and have the stylesheet do the layout i ve attepmted the popout inside the sidebar element positioned absolutely but then i cannot make the sidebar element itself scale to be at least as tall as the popout the sidebar elements are usually shorter in height than the popout i tried putting the popout before the element and using position absolute but for some reason the popout will not get wider if i add more buttons and instead overflows them downwards using position relative on the popout will make it leave empty space where it would have been in the sidebar floating it messes up the width of other sidebar elements the sidebar is fixed width the popout is fixed height the buttons are fixed size the sidebar elements are full width but variable height i ve lost track of all the different things i ve tried my closest attempt at the moment is in this jsfiddle where the popout is positioned correctly but does not grow leftwards only overflow downwards if i set the width to a large number it will line the buttons up correctly but it makes strange things happen if i add a hover pseudo class how could this be done in html css or is it only possible using javascript if so what could be a simple out of the way approach of doing this

listing a class s methods trough mixin i want to list methods of a class in a mixin to do it i assume i have to open the file containing the source code in the mixin but finding that file s name is harder than i thought i tried using but it gives the mixin declaration s file so i would have to define the mixin in every file which doesn t make any sense since the goal is to reduce boilerplate code for now my solution is to pass the filename as an argument inside the class s constructor and call the mixin from there since i will do that in all class that inherit from the same parent class i would ideally want to put it in the parent class s constructor and to register the child class s methods is there a better way of doing this anything that could search the class for methods without having to open the file

sql query hierarchical coalesce i have a table that defines a heirarchy hierarchy diagram for this data i want to write a query that will return a single row for any given id value the row should contain that row s id and parentid information it should also contain the largedata n fields however if a largedata field is null then it should traverse up the hierarchy until a non null value for that field is encountered it should in short function like the coalesce function except across a hierarchy of rows instead of a set of columns example where id where id where id where id where id so far i have this this returns the results that i am looking for however according to the query plan it is making a separate pass through the hierarchy for each largedata field that i pull back how can i make this more efficient this is obviously a simplified version of a more complex problem the final query will return data in xml format so any solutions involving the for xml clause are perfectly fine i can create a clr aggregate function for this if doing so would help i have not yet explored that route

libxml vs expat for an xmpp server i m trying to create an xmpp library and later a server from scratch in a new c like programming language although the language itself is irrelevant as a means to learn what i can about the xmpp protocol and server software development in general as many of you know xmpp is messaging protocol based on xml that depends on an enormous amount of short but frequent xml streams i m thinking that for such applications an event based xml parser should be better because i won t need dom and all that correct me if i m wrong please keep in mind that this library is intended for servers so there might be many instances run at once which one of the two has better performance and memory usage for that use case libxml or expat

ios application partitioning mvc i ve been playing around with ios development and i m getting to the stage where i want to create something beyond a simple app however i m not confident that i understand how to partition an application correctly for the purposes of simplicity imagine a very simple audio player application let s say there are two view controllers accessible via a uitabbarcontroller which is instantiated the main appdelegate class each of these view controllers has the following responsibility playerviewcontroller a sound player which plays the current audio sample when the user presses a button selectorviewcontroller a sample selector that uses a uipickerview to display the available audio samples so that the user can select which sample they want to play so far so good however what i don t quite understand is where i should store the data on the available samples so that both of the views can find out information on the available samples trigger a sample to play etc as both view controllers need to access this model level information would creating an audio manager singleton class be a sensible approach or is there much much more likely i m guessing a better means of solving this problem that i m overlooking any pointers would be much appreciated

evaluate math expressions without a stack how do you evaluate arbitrary math expressions using temporary variables instead of a stack what i m talking about is translating an expression into an array of simple operations each that change one variable based on the second argument an example list of operations might be notice how each operation changes the first argument none of them return anything here s a simple expression i have postfix with depth written under it as well notice how you don t need temporary variables here s an expression that requires a temporary variable i can t seem to figure out an algorithmic solution for obtaining these sets of operations needing temporary variables seems to have something to do with lower precedence operators that have the result of higher precedence operators as arguments but i can t tell i feel stupid the way seems right in front of me but i can t see it obviously you could do it the easy way aka make a temporary variable to store the result of each operation so no operations are destructive to anything but what you put before the but that s bad and i don t like it how can you get the algorithm for an expression in simplest form edit due to my own ambiguity i must clarify that a stack is allowed in translation but not in the end psuedo language i m producing

chirp transform and convolution i was reading about the discrete fourier transform from the clr algorithms book and i came upon an exercise whose hint confuses me the exercise reads as follows the chirp transform of a vector a a a ldots a n is a vector y y y ldots y n where y k sum j n a j z k j and z is any complex number the dft is therefore a special case of the chirp transform obtained by taking z omega n prove that the chirp transform can be evaluated in time o n lg n for any complex number z hint use the equation y k z k sum j n a j z j z k j to view the chirp transform as a convolution my question is about what is a convolution i am familiar with taking two vectors a a a ldots a n and b b b ldots b n and forming the convolution c c c ldots c n where c k sum j k a j b k j here the index of j runs from to k unlike in the hint given above where the index runs from to n in what sense is the hint above a convolution

calling the constructor of a large array of objects on a stack i m modifying some c source code and i ve noticed the author really went out of their way to allocate everything on the stack most likely for the deallocation benefits are there any performance benefits as well i want to keep the same consistency but i need to create a large array of objects and something like isn t going to cut it searching around it seems like a way around this is just this still allocates on the heap but deallocates like a stack from what i ve read in other posts i m just wondering are there any other options because this just seems like a syntax issue perhaps a clever define people know

calculating the size of a box for multiple products for carrier module in prestashop i am currently developing a carrier module for kuroneko which is a door to door japanese delivery company this carrier along with the weight takes the size of the box into consideration but it doe not use the volume it would be too easy it uses the sum of the three dimensions height weight and depth if you ve got only one product to box it s still easy but what happens when you need to box products let s say you have two products of dimensions x y z and x y z how do you calculate the final box size x y z in a way you keep x y z minimal here is my provisional solution but tell me if there s a better way to calculate let m be the minimal dimension of the first product min x y z and m for the second you have to account for rotations of the products in the box to fit them in the best way and thus define new dimensions nx ny nz for both products let s suppose that nx m if m x then ny y nz z else if m y then ny x nz z else if m z ny y nz x the total box size thus become nx max ny ny max nz nz but as far as i see i don t think this method will work for more than products any idea

php database abstraction define the model once generate the code but deal with plain data instead of active record objects i am searching for a database abstraction layer in future php projects until now i have worked with plain sql commands and arrays on the one hand fully featured orms like doctrine on the other hand i don t like orm because most of the time the job is to get a list of data from the database and to send it to the template engine both work fully fine with arrays and there s no need to make it all complicated by capsule the data in an object when the template just needs the plain array i don t like the plain sql approach either because for the simple crud stuff i have to write everything myself and also i don t like to maintain two models of my data one in the db and the other within my database access object is there something which let s me define the model one time only and generates the elementary stuff for me like in doctrine but which saves me from the active record pattern

do not use vpn credentials to connect to network resources i recently deployed a new remote access vpn system at my company using a cisco asa as the concentrator the protocol is l tp over ipsec for maximum compatibility across clients and authentication is handled by an rsa securid appliance everything works really well except in one particular scenario user s workstation is a domain member user is logging in to the local workstation as a domain user user is connecting to the vpn using the same user name as the logged in account user attempts to access network resources such as file shares or microsoft exchange in this case the user s account is locked in active directory almost immediately after attempting to connect to a network resource i e opening outlook i believe the issue is that windows is attempting to use the credentials provided for connecting to the vpn because the username matches but the password does not since it is actually a one time password generated by the securid token the authentication fails continuous attempts result in the account being locked out is there any way to tell windows to stop doing this i ve tried disabling the client for microsoft networks option in the vpn properties but it didn t help

load video file and select individual frames we are developing an app to take video files in various formats perform some simple editing to the files and output them to a specific format i can handle everything except for the editing part through ffmpeg as the editing requires a user to specify certain things i need a user to specific any frame ranges that need to be trimmed only from the beginning or end never the middle start end frame numbers for fading in or out and overlay text i ve seen both splicer and the directshow net wrappers but i m not sure it s worth the time to bring all of the editing into our app and not just use avisynth ffmpeg mencoder to perform the actual editing after the user sets all of the above things all i really need is a control or wrapper so i can create a control that will play pause a video move between frames and let me grab that specific frame number of the video i can generate avs files from that to do the rest it d be nice if it would use directshow at some level so that any codecs installed on the machine will be available as the videos could be in wmv flv divx mp etc to begin with and we need to support all of those any ideas or suggestions will be considered but we are going for the fastest code writing not execution implementation

iis url rewriting at initial host request i am having a problem with an iis integrated pipeline url rewrite for my particular scenario i need to rewrite redirect part of the initial request as follows user enters in the browser address bar user is redirected to results of this currently works as expected only if i create the initial request as such i must note that there is no actual directory of nor nor any file named on the server i simply need that entire path and filename appended to a query string this is my first day working with redirect rewrite functions using iis instead of page code behind and i have looked all around learn iis net google etc to no avail i understand that rewriting takes place before page requests but for some reason my particular code requires a page request before firing the redirect i suspect it is because i am not triggering conditions at the initial request 
wix uninstall close application before restart manager i have an installer done with wix when it s done installing it starts an application that injects some code in the explorer process currently when i uninstall the restart manager kicks in and offers to shut down my application and explorer instead of that i want to close my application manually this is done by running it again with exit on the command line i have a custom action that does it here s what i tried so far this doesn t work the action is done way after the restart manager session so the restart manager pops up and asks to close my app and explorer the action runs later but by then the app is already gone so then i tried this this also doesn t work the action is done too late still i also get warning lght ice some action falls between installinitialize and removeexistingproducts so basically how do i execute my custom action during uninstall and before the restart manager session i m guessing if i use impersonate no it might run at the right time however that s not an option that s because the new process must run for the same user as the process that has to close because it looks up its window and sends messages that s much trickier to do if the processes belong to different users any ideas thanks ivo

best way to extract segments values from varchar field in set based sql take the following example data what i would like to do is extract this data as follows as you can see i need to extract the ref type amp ourref as seperate columns to ensure efficient set based sql when processing the resulting emails usually for this scenario i would use a function such as this for example i then replace the white space before the ref to include a comma and split as follows as you can see i have a solution that gets the end result i m after but the use of a messy udf isnt ideal amp i was wondering if sql server has a better way of doing stuff like this perhaps inline regular expressions i e i think accepts regular expressions as a search string this in conjunction with could do what i need but i dont really know where to start edit please note that this is a simplified example the subject is variable and i ll also be adapting the same technique to parse the body the body will have items of data that i need to parse out using a variety of delimiters so this rules out the use of as it only allows parts and i can t use fixed length i e as the length will be very varied especially if different helpdesks are involved which they are this is why i was thinking along the lines of amp 
many user stories share the same technical tasks what to do a little introduction to my case as part of a bigger product my team is asked to realize a small ide for a dsl the user of this product will be able to make function calls in the code and we are also asked to provide some useful function libraries the team together with the po put on the wall a certain number of user stories regarding the various libraries for the ide user when estimating the first of those stories the team decided that the function call mechanism would have been an engaging but not completely obvious task so the estimate for that user story raised up from a simple to a more dangerous coming to the problem the team then moved to the user stories regarding the other libraries actually stories and added those points of function call mechanism thing to each of those user story this immediately raised up the total points for the product of points everyone in the team knows that each user story could be picked up by the po for the next iteration at any time so we shouldn t isolate that part in one user story but those points feel so awfully unrealistic i ve proposed a solution but i m absolutely not satisfied we created a design story and put those annoying points over it however when we came to realize and demonstrate it to our customers we were unable to show something really valuable for them about that story here the problem is whether we should ignore the principle of having isolated user stories without any dependency between them what would you do or even better what have you done in situations like this a small foot note following a suggestion i ve moved this question from stackoverflow

extracting leaf paths from n ary tree in f inspired by this question i wanted to try my hand at the latest ponder this challenge using f my approach is probably completely off course but in the course of solving this problem i m trying to get a list of all the permutations of the digits i m looking at solving it using a n ary tree like so i m quite pleased with myself because i ve managed to work out how to generate the tree that i want my problem now is that i can t work out how to traverse this tree and extract the path to each leaf as an int thing thing that is confusing me is that i need to match on individual nodes but my outer function needs to take a node list my current attempt almost does the right thing except that it returns me the sum of all the paths and i m not even sure that this is tail recursive you re quite welcome to propose another solution for finding permutations but i m still interested in the solution to this particular problem edit i ve posted a generic permutations algorithm in f here

button click event inside in external method i m trying to make a relatively basic text based rpg in c in visual studio an i ve gotten hung up trying to have a method in a class react to a button click on a form like to move from one method to another based on the button clicked let me give you a basic layout of the program i have a frmmain and a cls events it ll get more complex but that s for a time once i actually get stuff working i want the frmmain to be where the player interacts with the program it has the text screen buttons status meters most of the good fun stuff below the text screen are buttons labeled btn btn respectively that i plan on changing the text to to reflect the available actions of the current scene events inspect that go right tell that guy that you and his mother had dinner last night the controls to make the main menu are in cls events mostly to make it more convenient for a main menu button to just simply call it to get the player back to the main menu rather then just copy pasting the code from the frmmain method my cls events is where i want to actually code the events like the mainmenu event that ll change the text in the textbox change the text on the button to reflect the current options and disable the buttons i won t need i ve tried using a loop with a sleep method in it to check a variable that each button would add a different number to as long as intselected was the loop would continue btn would add etc etc but that caused the program to hang plus i feel that it would be a messy unprofessional way of doing what i want to do and while i may not be a professional even i have standards does anyone know of a way to pause the programs execution until a button is pressed or have a better idea on how to get done what i want to get done i can t just simply code the functions into the click events as what these buttons do would be constantly changing i will go ahead and say that c is not a language i am strong in i was originally doing this in vb net but ran into the same problem and was lead to believe that c was a bit more flexible the only c language i m even vaguely familiar with is c and my class in that was a least a year and a half ago so please forgive stupid coding as i am a little rusty

what discrete distribution is completely determined by its mode and variance is easy to sample and has nice border properties i need to generate random ordered unranked trees that will be used to test some computer program i d like to incorporate some kind of control into the generation process so that the generated trees have in expectation some desired properies like long chains node with child its child also has child or there are many children on level but not so many on level or if a node has few children its children are more likely to have more children but if it has many children its children are more likely to have less etc i ve chosen this approach define a tree as a prefix closed set of strings over some alphabet sigma such that if sc is in the set s in sigma c in sigma then for all b le c b in sigma sb is in the set i fix sigma and to generate a tree i generate a few strings over this alphabet treat them as nodes and then generate all other nodes from them by prefix closing the set etc the node string generation process is done symbol by symbol with symbol on level l generated as follows sample bernoulli distribution with parameter over d to see if we should stop that way expected length of the generated strings is d sample symbol from the distribution p s l t p s l p s t where s in sigma is the symbol being generated t in sigma is the previous generated symbol here p s l and p s t are parameters of the generation process i d like the user of this generation process to specify discrete distribution p s l over symbols from sigma for each l using just two parameters the expected symbol and variance same for p s t for each t the motivation is this say our symbols are then symbol s at level l determines the number of nodes at level l under the already generated node s if we define p s l to be sharply distributed around in the generated trees nodes at level l will in most cases have children and so on now to the question i need a family of functions that will be my p s l and p s t with the following properties the function is completely determined by parameters the first being its mode and the second being variance or something else that has the meaning of how sharp the values are distributed around the mean the distribution is easy to sample from i don t want to depend on some library for that nor write lots of complicated code the overall task is of low priority but of high curiosity for me the distribution behaves as expected if the mode is close to the beginning or end of the alphabet specifically assume again that our symbols are if the mode is the function should be strictly decreasing and if the mode is it should be symmetric beta binomial looked similar to what i wanted but i don t know if there is an easy way to sample from it and also i m not that familiar with it to come up with a good second parameter i d like to know if there is a simple well known distribution with such properties 
send pdf as byte json problem i am trying to send a generated pdf file apache fop to the client i know this can be done by writing the array to the response stream and by setting the correct content type length and so on in the servlet my problem is that the whole app was built based on the idea that it will only receive send json in the servlet s service method i have this requestbroker is the class who processes the json jackson processor everything is generic and i cannot change it on top of this i have to receive the json from the request correctly to access the data and generate my pdf so those two lines are necessary but when i send the response i need to have another content type so that the pdf is displayed correctly in the browser so far i am able to send the byte array as part of the json but then i don t know how to display the array as pdf on the client if smth like this is even possible i would like some suggestions on how can i send my pdf and set the right header without messing with the json thanks

integral extensions one prime lying over implies equal localization here s a problem from matsumura s book commutative ring theory page let a be a ring and let a subset b be an integral extension and mathfrak p a prime ideal of a suppose that b has just one prime ideal p lying over mathfrak p then b p b mathfrak p solution page b mathfrak p is integral over a mathfrak p so that any maximal ideal of b mathfrak p lies over mathfrak p a mathfrak p and therefore coincides with pb mathfrak p hence b mathfrak p is a local ring and the elements of b setminus p are units of b mathfrak p i don t understand the proof at all lot of questions where it says any maximal ideal of b mathfrak p lies over mathfrak p a p why is this and isn t b mathfrak p a local ring so why the expression any maximal ideal of b mathfrak p then it says hence b mathfrak p is a local ring isn t the localization always a local ring is it possible that you can please give another proof of the exercise or explain it in detail i m really confused about this proof thanks

random placement of rectangles with no overlaps i am looking for a sound algorithm that would randomly place a given number of rectangles of the same size into a bigger rectangle canvas i see two ways to do it create an empty array that will contain the rectangles already placed on canvas start with the empty canvas in a loop pick a position at random for a new rectangle to be placed check if the array has a rectangle that overlaps with the new rectangle if it does not put the new rectangle in to the array and repeat the loop otherwise pick a new position and rerun the check again and so on this might never terminate theoretically i think i do not like it use a grid and place rectangles into the cells randomly this might still look like a grid placement i do not like it either any better ways to do it better meaning more efficient or more visually random than the grid approach better in any respect thanks konstantin

wcf exception on certificate with signature algorithm sha dsa we are using wcf to call a java web service when we called the service on a test server it worked fine but when we moved to production we encountered the following exception failed to send request message over http the token s crypto collection does not support algorithm http www w org xmlenc rsa oaep mgf p one thing we noticed was that the development server certificate s signature algorithm is md rsa while the production certificate has the signature algorithm as sha dsa is it this rsa dsa mismatch that would cause the exception if so is it possible to configure wcf to handle dsa thanks

google calendar php newb question i ve been scouring around for information through the google calendar api the zend docs and here and just about everything i find seems to make assumptions on what i already know about php so i m just getting more lost i do have a good deal of programming experience with um a forth variant anyway i m trying to pass the output of a php script that can be used to get all of the important data from a calendar event into said forth variant what s driving me up the wall is that i can t figure out how to grab something as simple as the uid of a message here s what i m working with this is based off the example code they gave me and instead of formatting with with xml tags like in the example just puts each on its own new line which is easier for me to pull into the other language now i tried to add to the loop but it just tells me fatal error uncaught exception zend gdata app invalidargumentexception with message property uid does not exist in var mucktools zend gdata app base php so obviously i m going about grabbing the uid the wrong way now here s the thing these two lines are pulling data from the event however title text starttime all look like things pulled out of one s posterior i know cognitively that can t be true there is a library and an api here but i want to know where i can find a listing of all the crap i can pull out of event and what the syntax is to do so can anyone help me with this and before you ask yes i have a very good reason to be grabbing the output of a php script and stuffing it into an obscure forth variant and no there s not another way that won t be more complicated than this one i ve done my homework here

ideal implementation saving in documents on the roll or both question about iphone app programming i m storing photo s and video s in my app which works fine i have lines for adding it to the documents directory inside the app and lines for adding it to the photo roll however what is expected behaviour in the way of storing data do users want all stuff on the photo roll or only in app or both currently it s only in app but that would prevent users from getting it out of the app only photo roll is impossible for me since checking whether a photo is still on there is tedious storing on both places has the disadvantage of size should i pick one option or present users a preference what does apple want i ve picked up chatter about disallowing heavy storage apps from the store any thought or direction is much appreciated regards reinder

purely html css solution to resizing content in javascript please observe the following jsfiddle http jsfiddle net mark fnd dayca the content is fit exactly between the header and the footer this property of the layout is preserved if we add more items to the header notice the scroll bar and now scrolling it we can add more items to the content and scroll down the scroll bar disappears once we resize the window or reduce the content dom tree or reduce the header dom tree this behavior is enforced in code i was wondering whether there are html css tricks that achieve the same effect in a purely declarative manner here is the javascript code to keep so happy edit i would like to relax the constraints a bit let us suppose the height of the header is known and cannot be changed so both the header and the footer have fixed constant heights known beforehand

simple file upload using flex ui and spring hibernate blazeds backend i m new to flex and blazeds and i m trying to implement a simple application which uses flex on the front end and a spring hibernate application on the back end with communication between the two going over a blazeds channel i m seeking direction as to the best and or simplest way to approach this i have the ui set up in such a way that the user is presented with a file chooser in which they pick the image file they want to upload when this is chosen and submitted as a form submission then the server side should receive the image file data as well as some related metadata such as a description and date then populate a hibernate entity pojo with the image file data and related metadata and then persist the entity pojo into the database i have found some examples of how you would do a file upload and download using servlets here and the filereference class here and here but these don t appear to address the problem in a way which leverages blazeds and or spring hibernate i want to put the image file data and related metadata description capture date etc into a value object within the flex application and then send this over blazeds to a service provided by my spring hibernate application running on tomcat in this service i want to extract the image data both the actual jpg png gif data and the related metadata such as description etc from the value object sent from the flex app into an entity pojo which is then persisted via hibernate in my database can this be done and if so what s the best way to go about it am i mistaken in assuming that if i use blazeds then i am somehow bypassing the need to provide http based services such as servlets on the server side and instead i can use my java services as remoteobjects is there necessarily a one to one mapping between java pojo entity class and the flex value object class when making this sort of transfer if so is there a tool which creates corresponding flex value objects from java pojos or vice versa thanks in advance for your help comments suggestions etc james update some code to make this more clear i have this as my value object in flex i am assuming that this can be used as a one to one mapping to the pojo class used by my service and dao classes on the server side which looks like this in my flex application i populate the fields of an image object with a description string date and image file data based on the user s file selection and text input for the description and then call a method on the remoteobject which is mapped to the service running on tomcat i make the remoteobject service call within my flex code using the image value object as the argument but the service method running on the servier side actually expects an argument of the pojo entity type and it s here that i am thinking that some sort of conversion transformation between the flex value object and the java pojo will occur by virtue of the remoteclass alias setting on the value object s class declaration but it doesn t seem to be happening that way because when i debug the application the java service is only getting null values when the service call is made in my flex application i have a filereference and image value object as public bindable variables there is also an event handler to browse for a file when the user clicks on a file select button there is an event handler which builds the value object when the image file has been selected and there s an event handler which is invoked when the user clicks on the submit button to perform the image save upload on the server side my java class is doing a simple save of the pojo when i set a breakpoint in the method above and look at the image variable it looks to be empty so i m assuming that the transformation from the flex value object to the java pojo did not go as expected and that there s more to it than just adding a remoteclass alias in the flex value object class

are chained thread safe collections thread safe if i have the following declaration if i then chain a call like so is this thread safe to me it looks like only one of the two maps is synchronized but you cannot get to the inner map without going through the outer synchronized map so i am unsure edit excellent points made in both answers so far thanks a bunch but now i am thinking what if i did this then did my chained call is that entire chain thread safe is it possible that between the and that another thread could get the inner map i am thinking that if i want the entire chain thread safe i need to put it inside of a synchronized block but i am also wondering if this will work as well

algorithm to split an article without breaking the reading flow or html code i have a very large database of articles of varying lengths the articles have html elements in them i have to insert some ads simple lt script gt elements in the body of each article when it is displayed i know i hate ads that interrupt my reading too now the problem is that each ad must be inserted at about the same position in each article the simplest solution is to simply split the article on a fixed number of characters without breaking words and insert the ad code this however runs the risk of inserting the ad in the middle of a html tag i could go the regex way but i was thinking about the following solution using js establish a character count threshold for example the add should be inserted at about words set accepted deviations in each direction say characters loop through each text node inside the article and while doing so keep count of the total number of characters so far once the count exceeds the threshold make the following decision if count exceeds the threshold by a value lower that the positive accepted deviation for example characters insert the ad code just after the current text node if the count is greater than the sum of the threshold and the deviation roll back to the previous text node and make the same decision only this time use the previous count and check if it s lower than the difference between the threshold and the deviation and if not insert the ad between the current node and the previous one if the and fail which means that the previous node reached a too low character count and the current node a too high one insert the ad after whatever character count is needed inside the current element i know it s convoluted but it s the first thing out of my mind and it has the advantage that by trying to insert the ad between text nodes perhaps it will not break the flow of the article as bad as it would if i would just stick it in like the final case here is some pseudo code i put together i don t trust my english explaining skills am i over complicating stuff or am i missing a simpler more elegant solution ps both server side and client side solutions are ok for me 
responsibility between script and host application i ve been trying to decide how to embed lua into my application for scripting and extension purposes i have a class which handles objects that have structures which resemble lua tables specifically a hash map of lua scripts would interact with these objects and their hash maps it is becoming clear to me that i could write the entirety or a large chunk of this class in lua and access it from c but i am uncertain of the consequences of doing so particularly memory usage with regard to creating the many tables to represent the hash maps the reason for coming to this conclusion is that i would like to store high level structures from lua in these c objects but doing so would require an explicit table serialization every time a table is stored into or retrieved from a c object theoretically this approach would offer less memory usage in a trade off for higher latency per access what are the possible courses of action in this situation and their advantages and disadvantages

isoperimetric problem in the calculus of variations i m trying to solve the following isoperimetric problem a plane curve has length l and end points at and a on the positive x axis show that the area a under this curve is given by a int l y sqrt y ds where y dy ds find the function y s and the value of a which maximises a and in turn determine that the curve in the x y plane is a semicircle i have managed to show that the area is given by the above integral by writing a int a ydx and using the fact that ds dx dy using the euler lagrange equation i found that the function y s is given by y s c mathrm sin left frac s c k right where c and k are constants then applying the conditions y and y l i get k and c frac l pi so that y s frac l pi mathrm sin left frac s pi l right this looks ok so far but now i m not sure how to find the value of a which maximises a and i also don t know how to show that the function y s gives a semicircle in the x y plane substituting y s into a and evaluating i get a frac l pi which is what would be expected for a semi circle but i don t think that this helps am i supposed to use the fact that l int a sqrt y dx or something i think i must be missing something obvious here

windows modern ui apps how to snap at center with the modern windows ui you can have utmost two apps showing on the screen at a time however you have to select a primary app which occupies the majority of the screen space the other app occupies less than of the screen space you can toggle between the views to change the sharing of screen space between these apps however there are many scenarios where one wishes to have two apps open on the screen with each occupying half the screen an example could be watching a lecture and taking notes at the same time this is currently not possible in the metro mode and i cannot understand why i certainly do not see any technical difficulty in its implementation is there a way to achieve this without going to the desktop view and if not any clue why this is not supported

creating an asp net treeview with multiple levels i have a requirement to create a multi level treeview in asp net with vb but i am completely stuck on how to start this currently my treeview is a fixed level approach but now i need to rewrite this to be more dynamic and support extra levels being added into our database tables so this treeview needs to support as many levels as needed without having to rewrite any code each time we want to add new level ideally we will just insert the data at the database level i think i have the database part designed correctly i created tables and has columns and has columns and doing this query will return this data from here i am unsure where to go i read that the asp treeview can take xml as its datasource and this seems to be a good idea but how could i select the data into a format which would support multiple levels etc if anyone knows how to do this or could link me to a guide i would be very appreciative also if doing this as xml is a bad idea i am open to other suggestions i m still learning asp net so i would like to do this properly to be thorough this is the code i am currently replacing which generates the treeview for me

cloud architecture concepts in a system architecture diagrams if you design a distributed application for easy scale out or you just want to make use of any of the new cloud computing offerings by amazon google or microsoft there are some typical concepts or components you usually end up using distributed blob storage aka s asynchronous durable message queues aka sqs non relational non transactional databases like simpledb google bigtable azure sql services distributed background worker pool load balanced edge service processes handling user requests often virtualized distributed caches like memcached cdn content delivery network like akamai now when it comes to design and sketch an architecture that makes use of such patterns are there any commonly used symbols i could use or even a download with some cool visio stencils it doesn t have to be a formal system like uml but i think it would be great if there were symbols that everyone knows and understands like we have commonly used shapes for databases or a documents for example i think it would be important to not mix it up with traditional concepts like a normal file system local or network server san or a relational database simply speaking i want to be able to draw some conclusions about an application s scalability or data consistency issues by just looking at the system architecture overview diagram update thank you very much for your answers i like the idea of putting a small cloud symbol on the traditional symbols however i leave this thread open just in case someone will find specific symbols maybe in a book or so or uploaded some pimped up visio stencils

mpi in conjunction with opencl while dividing my application in various tasks and convert it for a multi thread environment i have realized that fundamentally i ve got the base concept wrong opencl is not suited for the kind of operations that i need to do in my app but only for the mathematical part of the problem so at this point i was wondering if i could use mpi to fire up n threads on different devices and then fire up opencl kernels if the device has a gpu is this something that is commonly done or using mpi exclude ocl and vice versa my objective is to run an app on a computer and use any device attached to it if present to increase the computational power and share the task the task itself is divided between crunching numbers perfect for ocl ogl render of the results coming from the data crunching part ui management and interaction and data management save store replace from what i understand mpi is not able to address threads to the gpu like ocl does but ocl main use is math crunching so it would not do any good if for example my app needs to access the network to retrieve information or if it needs to use ogl to plot the results of a thread in which case the best choice would be mpi any suggestion about a viable option would be more than appreciated

passing an argument to a powershell script to be used for the test path include option this is my first time asking a question so bear with me i am teaching myself powershell by writing a few basic maintenance scripts my question is in regard to a clean up script i am writing which accepts arguments to determine the target directory and files to delete the problem the script accepts an optional argument for a list of file extensions to look for when processing the deletion of files i am trying to test for the existence of the files prior to actually running the delete i use test path with the include parameter to run the check within a validatescript block it works if i pass in a single file extension or no file extensions however when i try to pass in more than one file extension it fails i have tried using the following variations on the code inside the script for each of the above possibilities i have run the script from the command line using the following variations for the multi extension file list example of the error message the full script is below i have not yet added the actual code to delete files because i am still working on accepting and validating the arguments passed in i have searched google and stackoverflow but i have not found a solution to this particular problem i assume i am either doing something wrong with the code or there is a better way to accomplish what i want to do note i should mention that i also tried running the test path with multiple file extensions outside of the script with no problems script

datepicker bound to a datetime string was not recognized as a valid datetime disclaimer this exception has been reported in numerous other threads and yes i have googled around trying to find a solution to my issue i have a wpf application with a wpf toolkit datepicker control bound to a datetime variable whenever i enter a date such as the datepicker control seems to think it s actually in uk date format dd mm yyyy and the wpftoolkit source code throws an exception of string was not recognised as a valid datetime this abruptly stops any chance of wpf performing change notifications to other parts of the app which need to know when this date changes screenshot of vs exception i m baffled my laptop is setup to display dates in the form mm dd yyyy and i ve specifically tried telling my app to use this us date format first using this code then out of desperation using this code but regardless of what i try the datepicker throws an exception whenever i choose a date which can t be parsed using dd mmm yyyy if i look at the line of code taken from datepicker cs in the wpf toolkit sdk which throws the exception i ve found that datetimehelper getculture this does correctly return en us but that the getdateformat function is getting the wrong date format it s somehow returning dd mmm yyyy rather than mmm dd yyyy getdateformat s return values i m really confused i ve even tried cut n pasting the getdateformat function taken from the following path in the wpftoolkit source code into my app and tried to get it to reproduce the wrong date format problem but when it s in my code it runs fine and parses mmm dd yyyy dates correctly every time wpftoolkit calendar microsoft windows controls datetimehelper cs why would the wpftoolkit code have a different culture to my wpf application s code which uses it and how can i get the wpftoolkit to use the correct culture

complex floating point sequential logic in verilog i m trying to write a synthesizable d rasterizer in verilog systemverilog the rasterizer right now is not really a d rasterizer it just receives six bits floats for vertex position verta pos x verta pos y vertb pos x vertb pos y vertc pos x vertc pos y and nine bits integers for vertex coloring verta color r verta color g verta color b vertb color r vertb color g vertb color b vertc color r vertc color g vertc color b positions ranges are f f f representing the top left side of the screen f the middle of it and f the bottom right side the raster work would be to first count how many raster lines are required given that the framebuffer height is pixels vertex a is the top vertex b is the bottom left one c is the bottom right one and x is the bottommost vertex either b or c this has to be calculated the number of raster lines is given by this part of the rasterization process is complex enough to expose my doubts so i ll stop explaining how i would proceed here now what i want to know is how to implement such complex logic in verilog it is complex because it is sequential and takes more than one clock cycle which is not exactly the most pleasant kind of thing to design with a hardware description language i am using altera s quartus and so i m mainly interested in altera solutions the floating point operation megafunctions that come with quartus all require more than one clock cycle to finish so to implement simple calculations like i m assuming a fairly boring to write and error prone state machine is necessary my biggest expectation is that someone will tell me i don t need that but if that s not the case i still would like to know how people generally design things like these also notice that i m very new to verilog and hardware design in general so i m sorry if i say something stupid ideas

why do the two topologies on a galois group coincide in the following one is referred to the book at this page the author defines krell topology on a galois group not necessarily finite at the th page of the same book the quthor defines then the product topology on a profinite group since a galois group is also a profinite group and as these two topologies are actually the same which fact the author chooses to leave as an exercise one asks thus why the two topologies coincide more precisely let g gal omega k be a galois group which is also a profinite group lim gal omega l where omega is a galois extension and l is a finite galois extension of k then why are the krull topology on g and the product topology on g viewed as a profinite group homeomorphic i have pondered upon the relations between these two topologies for some time but cannot explicitly formulate an isomorphism or rather the reason why the map is an isomorphism so please help in clarifying their relations thanks in advance

how are sql server cals counted possible duplicate can you help me with my software licensing question running a sql server as far as i understand it you need one cal for every user who connects to the database server but what happens if the only computer which is accessing the sql server is the server running your business layer if for example you got sql server and business logic server and clients who all just query and use the business logic server no client is using the sql server directly no one is even allowed to contact it so since there is only one computer using the sql server do i need only cal i somehow can t believe this would count as only cal needed for the sql server but i would like to know why not

intel tbb parallelization overhead why does intel threading building blocks tbb have such a large overhead according to section automatic chunking in the its around half a millisecond this is an exert from the tutorial caution typically a loop needs to take at least a million clock cycles for parallel for to improve its performance for example a loop that takes at least microseconds on a ghz processor might benefit from parallel for from what i have read so far tbb uses the threadpool pool of worker threads pattern internally and it prevents such bad overheads by only spawning worker threads once initially which costs hundreds of microseconds so what is taking the time data synchronization using mutexes isn t that slow right besides doesn t tbb make use of lock free data structures for synchronization

can how do you add a circle of references without breaking ri i m primarily interested in pgsql for this but i was wondering if there is a way in any rdbms to do an insert operation without disabling and re enabling any foreign key or not null constraints on two tables that refer to each other you might think of this as a chicken that was somehow born from its own egg for a practical example if you had a multiple choice quiz system with tables question and answer where question correct answer refers to answer id and answer question refers to question id is it possible to add a question and its answers simultaneously for the record i m aware that you can do the disabling and re enabling in a transaction block and that another solution is to not have a correct answer column but instead have answer correct as a boolean and have a check constraint making sure there s exactly one correct answer per question but i m not curious about alternative solutions here

smart way to perform a similar replacement not simple enough for diff in multiple files i have a bunch of files so too many to edit them manually without going crazy which all require the same changes as seen in the three diffs at the end of this question most tools used for search and replace on the commandline only support line by line replacements so they won t work is there some commandline tool available which can do the job basically performing a multi line regex search amp replace with backreferences without shoving the whole regex into a single line i e it should be read from a file or stdin should be enough but maybe there s an even better solution to do this if the indentation is not preserved it s not a big issue

hardware load balancing rules for the group routing of multiple ip domains from one load balancer vip we have purchased x apache servers and have a mysql server running behind them we are using a hardware load balancer to balance the requests to the apache servers our problem is that we set the rules for the load balancer lb to use the main public ips of the apache servers so that balancing happens on a per server basis in the group also the a records of all the domains on the server to be balanced are pointing to the vip of the lb now the issue is once someone hits www example com they are forwarded to the lb vip which sends them to the apache server ip ie the issue is now is that the apache servers cannot route the request now to the domain s ip for www example com ie how can we manage multiple domain routing from the main apache servers which are sent requests from the vip of the lb thanks in advance 
preserving the java type of an object when passing it from java to jython i wonder if it possible to not have jython automagicaly transform java objects to python types when you put them in a java arraylist example copied from a jython console so far everything is fine but if i put the object in an arraylist the object is transformed into a python like boolean i e an int and which means that i can no longer see that this was once a java lang boolean clarification i guess what really want to achieve is to get rid of the implicit conversion from java types to python types when passing objects from java to python i will give another example for clarification a python module and a java class that uses this module here i will see the output bool because of the implicit conversion but what i would really like is to see javainstance or java lang boolean if you want to run this code you will also need the jythonfactory class that can be found here

receiving multicast messages on a multihomed windows pc i m developing a diagnostic tool on a pc with several network interfaces based on multicast udp the user can select a nic the application creates sockets binds them to this nic and adds them to the specific multicast group the sending of multicast messages works fine however receiving of messages only succeeds if i bind the sockets to a specific nic of my pc it almost looks like as there is a default nic for receiving multicast messages in windows which is always the first nic returned by the getadapterinfo function i monitored the network with wireshark and discovered that the igmp join group message isn t sent from the nic i bound the socket at but by this default nic if i disable this nic or remove the network cable the next nic of the list returned by getadapterinfo is used for receiving multicast messages i was successful to change this default nic by adding an additional entry to the routing table of my pc but i don t think this is a good solution of the problem the problem also occurs with the code appended below the join group messages isn t sent via but via a different nic socket tst cpp defines the entry point for the console application include tchar h include winsock h include ws ipdef h include iphlpapi h include iptypes h include stdio h int tmain int argc tchar argv wsadata m wsadata socket m socket sockaddr in m sockadr uint m port u long m interfaceadr inet addr u long m multicastadr inet addr int returnvalue wsastartup makeword amp m wsadata if returnvalue s ok return returnvalue create sockets if invalid socket m socket socket af inet sock dgram ipproto udp return wsagetlasterror int doreuseaddress true if setsockopt m socket sol socket so reuseaddr char amp doreuseaddress sizeof doreuseaddress socket error return wsagetlasterror configure socket addresses memset amp m sockadr sizeof m sockadr m sockadr sin family af inet m sockadr sin port htons m port m sockadr sin addr s addr m interfaceadr bind sockets if bind m socket sockaddr amp m sockadr sizeof m sockadr socket error return wsagetlasterror join multicast struct ip mreq source imr memset amp imr sizeof imr imr imr multiaddr s addr m multicastadr address of multicastgroup imr imr sourceaddr s addr sourceaddress not used imr imr interface s addr m interfaceadr interface address first join multicast group then registerer selected interface as multicast sending interface if setsockopt m socket ipproto ip ip add membership char amp imr sizeof imr socket error return socket error else if setsockopt m socket ipproto ip ip multicast if char amp imr imr interface s addr sizeof amp imr imr interface s addr socket error return socket error printf receiving msgs n while get inputbuffer from socket int sock return socket error sockaddr in socketaddress char buffer return thanks four your help

what is agile development i ve been hearing a lot of buzz recently about agile development to the extent that a lot of job postings even list experience with it as a requirement now i ve read the wikipedia article and some of the other questions asked here but i m still not exactly clear on what employers are expecting when they say years of experience with agile development if i ve coded a project without having a page design document when i started does that constitute agile development experience if i launch an app with a few core feature and then add more later signals style is that agile development what are employers really expecting of developers when they say that edit this question shares many similarities with agile programming for non technical people getting started with agile and tdd selling points of agile practices trying to sell agile development you have to sell agile to management 
paste multi line string into gvim at cursor position when i copy a two line text from e g a pdf opened in acrobat reader into gvim using ctrl v the text is inserted above the line in gvim where i was positioned instead of at the position where my cursor is scenario i want to copy a document title that is spread over two lines and paste it in between a html tag in gvim if i do the same with a single line of text the text is correctly pasted at the cursor s position what should i do to make it also work with two lines of text e g something like paste without formatting important the string to be pasted consists of two lines separated by a carriage return or something similar solution there are actually two valid solutions using ctrl r to paste at the cursors position and keeping the clipboard content multi lined do a remapping of the paste command to replace all carriage returns in the clipboard string

reference for the range of possible values in hahn banach theorem this is the usual formulation of hahn banach theorem some books use sublinear function instead but it probably does not make much difference let x be a vector space and let p x to mathbb r be any convex function let m be a vector subspace of x and let f m to mathbb r be a linear functional dominated by p on m then there is a linear extension hat f of f to x that is dominated by p on x however if you look into the proof you find out that it shows that for a given v in x there exists an extension with the value hat f v c for any choice of c anywhere between sup x in m lambda gt frac lambda f x p x lambda v le c le inf y in m mu gt frac mu p y mu v f y if p is positive homogeneous i e p lambda x lambda p x for lambda gt than the expression for the range is simpler sup x in m f x p x v le c le inf y in m p y v f y in case the p and f have the additional property that forall x in x forall y in m p x y p x f y then the above interval can be simplified to p v le c le p v this situation happens quite often take for example f x lim x on the space c of all convergent sequences and the function p x limsup x on the space ell infty of all bounded sequences on several occasions i found the above observations useful since sometimes the function p x can be chosen in a such way that the set of linear functionals which we want to study is precisely the set of all extensions of some given functional fulfilling hat f x le p x hence this might give some additional information about an interesting set of functionals so i wonder why i have not find a book where hahn banach theorem was not formulated with the inclusion of the information about the possible range of those extensions question do you know about a reference giving a formulation of hahn banach theorem which includes the information about possible values of extensions question were the extreme points of the set of hahn banach extensions studied by the set of hahn banach extensions i mean the set of all linear functionals hat f x to mathbb r fulfilling forall x in x hat f x le p x and forall x in m hat f x f x for a given linear functional f m to mathbb r and a convex function p x to mathbb r edit perhaps i should mention that the formulation and the proof of hahn banach theorem i followed is from aliprantis border infinite dimensional analysis as far as i remember all proofs of hbt i ve seen have pretty much the same idea thus my guess is that the answer to the following question would be probably negative but i ll ask it anyway question have you seen a formulation or a proof of hahn banach theorem that would yield substantially different expression for the bounds i ve given above i believe its more or less obvious from the proof that these bounds are best possible in the sense that extension of f dominated by p cannot have value in the point v outside the given intervals so only change that could happen would be some different expression of the same value alternatively some books might contain proof of hbt which does not obtain the optimal bounds but again i do not see any way how this would simplify the proof so there s probably no reason to give such a proof

how do i design classes when doing ui i notice a pattern when i did c and backend programming in c or any language all my classes are neat and tidy recently i notice all my code are in a class and i literally have functions in it i now realize its because i am doing ui if i were to separate them by pages or forms dialogs i would have a lot more files more lines of code and longer line of code if i separate them i get the same problem more files lines longer lines obviously the less lines the better less code less to debug change or break during maintenance this specific project is k lines with k being from the web or libraries all my cs files are lt k lines is this acceptable even though i have functions in a single class bonus i notice most of these functions are called only once and putting certain code blocks such as one function make two calls to the db as their own function makes it harder for me to edit since they are divide between files and this balloon function count so i kind of dont know what to do do i create more classes to reduce function count per class it will increase function calls overall and already most are only called once how do i design classes doing frontend ui 
jquery blur event fired twice in chrome i created a simple infinite form with input fields every time an empty input is focused it creates a new one and on blur of an empty input field the field is removed see example here i use the following code to make it all happen the problem is however that in chrome the event is fired twice when i switch to another application tab this gives an error because it is not possible to remove the node since it s already gone firefox seems to work fine so why is the event fired twice and how can i prevent that from happening edit tried the answer in this question but no luck still get the error message in chrome what am i doing wrong see updated fiddle is there a way to check if the element still exists because the second time fires the node is removed still is non zero though

why is icommand better than code behind calling the vm i have a co worker that asked me why he has to use the icommand pattern he wants to add a button and then make an event for it in the code behind then from the event he wants to call a method on the viewmodel i gave him the obvious answer this adds coupling between the view and the viewmodel but he argued that the view and the viewmodel are already coupled we set our view s datacontext to the viewmodel in the view s code behind yes i told him that his way adds more coupling but it sounded a bit lame even to me so i know that icommand is the clean way and i do it that way but what else does icommand buy you besides not using an already existing coupling

is it a good practice to use an mvc application s own web api for ajax bindings i m writting an application that has many ajax widgets kendo ui to be percise it s starting to get messy to have all those ajax responses without the standard controllers so i was starting to consider making each entities their own controller if i m taking the time to do this i figured i might as well go foward and do those as webapis since i was planning to do this in a not so close future but hey it would be done already so my question is is it a good practice to use an mvc application s own web api as a ajax widget feeds or is there any reason to stick with standard controllers i ve seen some arguments about performance but i don t think this applies to this situation i believe it was more of a controller calling webapi situation which has obvious performance hits but since it s already a client side ajax call weither it goes into a standard mvc controller or a webapi controller shouldn t change a thing would it edit additional information regarding the project i am using entity framework for the data access i have a repository pattern going on with unitofwork i am using proper a mvc structure ef pocos automapped to dto pocos in the repository and fed into view models by the controllers this is a mvc project on net there is a lot of database relationships specially for the object i m working with at the moment

implementing scrubby sliders in cocoa how would i go about implementing something along the lines of scrubby sliders like in photoshop and quite a few other image processing applications they are slightly hard to describe basically you have a regular numeric input box but you can click and hold the mouse button and it functions like a slider until you release if you click in the box you can select text edit paste etc as usual the photoshop docs describe it and i put together a quick example video an example of the sliders in shake another similar implementation would be the jog wheel in final cut pro which functions similarly without the numeric readout being underneath i can t seem to find any mention of implementing these although there is probably alternative names for this it is for a os x cocoa application it is for a colour grading application where a user might need to make tiny adjustments for example to huge adjustments say on the same control a regular slider isn t accurate enough over that range of value copy and pasting values into the box would be a secondary concern to scrubbing the values and the photoshop shake setup really well the unobviousness of the control is also of a low concern as it s not a regular desktop application

how is values implemented for java enums in java you can create an enum as follows this question concerns the values method specifically how is it implemented usually i could jump to the source for java classes using f or ctrl click in eclipse even for classes like string character integer and even enum it is possible to view the source of the other enum methods e g valueof string does values create a new array each time it is invoked if i assign it to a local variable and then modify one of the elements what happens clearly this won t affect the value returned by values which implies that a new array is allocated each time is the code for it native or does the jvm compiler treat it specially only returning a new instance from values when it cannot prove that it will not be modified thanks in advance cheers les

does sql server s database tuning advisor modify data i ve been trying to increase performance and diagnose deadlocks on a sql server instance it had been running sql server until a month ago when an in situ upgrade was done after the upgrade we ve experienced a number of issues performance is down and deadlocks are way up ms suggested we use s database engine tuning advisor dta deta i m generally am skeptical of automated tools like this but message dta tossed up on start up is what really spooked me in the workload section select a database to which database engine tuning advisor will connect for analyzing the workload if your workload include events or transact sql statements that change the database database engine tuning advisor will also change the database while analyzing the workload finally select one or more databases or specific tables to tune which implies at least to me that it will re run any and all of the statements when doing the workload analysis is that the case if so does it rollback statements and transactions as it does so or just chew through everything in a trace file verbatim a side question what difference does the database for workload analysis make it defaults to master does it make more sense to leave it at master or change it to the name of the database i want tuned thanks in advance nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp aaron

questions about hyperbolic isometries the standard inversion i have two questions regarding the inversion across the unit circle in the hyperbolic plane recall that the hyperbolic plane is a metric space consisting of the open half plane mathbb h z in mathbb c im z and that for a curve gamma parametrized by a differentiable vector valued function t mapsto x t y t a leq t leq b the hyperbolic length is given by l hyp gamma int a b frac sqrt x t y t y t dt lastly the hyperbolic distance between two points p and q in the hyperbolic plane d hyp p q is the infimum of the hyperbolic lengths of all piecewise differentiable curves gamma going from p to q question solved what is the relationship between the standard inversion in rectangular and polar coordinates the standard inversion is an isometry of mathbb h d hyp that is defined by varphi x y frac x x y frac y x y i am having trouble understanding the motivation for this isometry and why it is introduced so i thought that it may have a more clean representation in polar form the following is my attempt to define the standard inversion in polar form let x r cos theta and y r sin theta then we have that varphi r theta left frac r cos theta r cos theta r sin theta frac r sin theta r cos theta r sin theta right by sin theta cos theta we then have varphi r theta left frac r cos theta r frac r sin theta r right varphi r theta left frac cos theta r frac sin theta r right yet when i look up the standard inversion in polar form it is defined as varphi r theta left frac r theta right where have i gone wrong question in the proof that the standard inversion is an isometry of mathbb h d hyp i have two questions here is the proof given in the book i am reading through low dimensional geometry from euclidean surfaces to hyperbolic knots by francis bonahon the image varphi gamma under the inversion varphi is parametrized by t mapsto x t y t a leq t leq b with x t frac x t x t y t and y t frac y t x t y t then x t frac y t x t x t x t y t y t x t y t y t frac x t y t y t x t y t x t x t y t so that after simplifications x t y t frac x t y t x t y t it follows that l hyp varphi gamma int a b frac sqrt x t y t y t dt l hyp varphi gamma int a b frac sqrt x t y t y t dt l hyp varphi gamma l hyp gamma therefore the standard inversion is an isometry of mathbb h d hyp my problem with the proof is that i do not understand how x t and y t are arrived at i understand the motivation the completion of the proof and how showing that if the hyperbolic length of the curve under the inversion is the same as the hyperbolic length of the curve then the inversion is an isometry additionally i could not complete the so that after simplifications part and i think that is just an algebra problem where i didn t see something clever conclusion in short i am looking for an answer that points out my error in converting the standard inversion in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates and provides the correct way for question for question i am looking for an explanation of how x t and y t are arrived at and how the step in the proof after so that after simplifications is accomplished full algebra not necessary thank you for any responses

how does adding a private member variable break c abi compatibility the pimpl idiom is commonly used in order to allow changing code in dynamically linked libraries without breaking abi compatibility and having to recompile all the code that depends on the library most of the explanations i see mention that adding a new private member variable changes the offsets of public and private members in the class that makes sense to me what i don t understand is how in practice this actually breaks the dependent libraries i ve done a lot of reading on elf files and how dynamic linking actually works but i still don t see how changing the class size in the shared lib would break things e g here is a test application a out i wrote that uses code from a test shared library libinterface so the call to uses the procedural linkage table plt which subsequently goes to the global offset table got where address x a c is contained and then this is where the dynamic linker works its magic and looks through all the symbols contained in the shared libs in ld library path finds in libinterface so and loads its code into the got so on subsequent calls to the code in the got is actually the code segment from the shared library or something along those lines but given the above i still don t understand how the shared lib s class size or its method offsets come into play here as far as i can tell the steps above are agnostic to the class size it looks like only the symbol name of the method in the library is included in a out any changes in class size should just be resolved at runtime when the linker loads the code into the got no what am i missing here

is there an svn command to remove files from the client only in perforce you can issue a sync to none command to remove files from the client but leave them untouched in the depot or repository in svn lingo p sync none is there a similar command in svn edit thanks to those that have answered so far to clarify i don t want to use rm rf on the directory since it will remove all files even those that are local only i also don t want to have to go through by hand deleting individual files which are on the client and in the repository the p sync none command allows me to remove files from the client which are in the depot repository and leaves local only files alone with a small set of files this is not a big deal but with numerous files it is painful to do by hand

enthought canopy on mac os x installing external program dolfin fenics over the past few weeks i started programming in python and have been using enthought canopy s python environment using mac os x i m interested in modeling incompressible navier stokes equation using the python module fenics dolfin but i have been having problems trying to install it initially i downloaded dolfin for python at https pypi python org pypi dolfin inside the dolfin folder s install file there are steps for a simple build and install and it says to issue the commands so i downloaded cmake from www cmake org assuming all i have to do is download and install it then i ll be able to reference in the terminal then i went into the mac terminal went to the location of the dolfin folder and tried the above commands which clearly didn t work so i thought i would try to just install fenics in its entirety from fenicsproject org download osx details html however fenics is built against system python and will not work with other python packages enthought canopy provided information to install external packages https support enthought com entries installing external packages into canopy python but i figured i was following step by the follow standard python installation procedures from the command line so in short i m at a loss for how to install dolfin into enthought canopy 
git what is a graftcommit or a graft id on git filter branch it is said to set a commit which typically is at the tip of another history to be the parent of the current initial commit in order to paste the other history behind the current history if the parent string is empty which happens when we are dealing with the initial commit add graftcommit as a parent this is exactly what i want to i e to set the parent to commit of some root commit see here for a related question but what exactly is the graft id in that command is that the new parent i e further on an even simpler example is given to achieve the same or even simpler again what is supposed to be in this example and right or is it and i also read this but i still don t really understand why i need such a concept here why can t i just do or so ok i think i figured it all out see my own answer to explain why i needed it in our project openlierox we had google breakpad included at one point we didn t took it from the official svn because it didn t worked at that time for me but from the latest lastfm stable instead it was just random that is was from there i had it also on my disk and knew that the lastfm people probably took some stable breakpad version then when time went on we applied several patches to our own copy of google breakpad now many months later we want to clean the histories a bit up get a good overview of all our patches to breakpad and maybe also get them upstream and most importantly for us we want to update our copy of breakpad so i thought that the best thing would be to create a new git repository fetch the official source history from somewhere into it and get all the breakpad specific stuff from our main repository via into it i used this breakpad mirror as a base the was also a bit more complicated because we moved the whole breakpad directory at one point inside the openlierox repository so i ended up with three branches first run for the time when breakpad was in second run for the time when breakpad was in copy of from the breakpad mirror then i searched for the commit in which was most close to the root in i didn t got any perfect match so i used the most close one wrote a small python script to figure that out this one is tagged now as and then i wanted to merge these three histories all together this went fine the way described above and given my own answer below the result is here openlierox google breakpad on github

what is a function f n returning latex code requiring exactly n compilations to yield stable output is there a simple recipe for producing latex code requiring exactly n compilations that is i m looking for an algorithm function f n with domain and latex code as its range if that makes answering easier i ll be happy about a solution requiring n to be above a certain threshold say or since most ordinary code requires not more than or runs of ideally the solution isn t too contrived and easy to comprehend direct solutions as well as solutions with recursive characteristics are welcome note this question grew out of this question about patterns increasing the number of required latex compilation runs 
matlab finding interpolated x value given y value when data is in an array i have an array of x values and an array of y values when plotted there are two peaks where the slope in those regions is very steep my goal is to find the fwhm of those peaks i can find the value of y at half maximum but given the steepness of the slope and the fact that my data is in an array i am having difficulty finding the x values which correspond to this y value i was thinking of using a loop to find the points directly before and after the given y value then using those to fit a line the high slope makes it so the curve can be approximated by a linear equation in that small region and using those equations to find the interpolated x values from which i can calculate the full width here is my coding for this so far when i run this code there are m arrays but each time it gets overwritten how can i save those arrays so i can recall later is there a simpler approach to this problem let me know if i can clarify my question thanks a lot

nhibernate flushmode auto not flushing before find all right i ve seen some posts asking almost the same thing but the points were a little bit different this is a classic case i m saving updating an entity and within the same session i m trying to get them from the database using criteria find enumerable etc with flushmode auto the matter is nhibernate isn t flushing the updates before querying so i m getting inconsistent data from the database fair enough some people will say as the documentation states this process flush occurs by default at the following points from some invocations of find or enumerable from nhibernate itransaction commit from isession flush the bold some invocations clearly says that nh has no responsibility at all imo though we have a consistency problem here because the doc also states that except when you explicity flush there are absolutely no guarantees about when the session executes the ado net calls only the order in which they are executed however nhibernate does guarantee that the isession find methods will never return stale data nor will they return the wrong data so if i m using createquery find replacement and filtering for entities with property value nh may not return entities with value right but that s what happens in fact because the flush is not happening automatically when it should after all am i getting it wrong is it a bug or simply a non predictable feature so everybody have to call flush to assure its work thank you filipe

can i get teamcity or chrome to display config files served as application octet stream within the browser using teamcity i can browse into the build artifacts created from a specific build and click to download individual files within the build when clicking on a file in a build artifact package teamcity serves it with the mime type which means instead of just displaying it as text within the browser google chrome it downloads it and uses visual studio to open it there s two ways i can see that i could just view the config file in chrome either configure teamcity to serve it as or some other supported mime type or modify chrome via a plug in to ignore the mime type for files whose filename or content disposition ends with config has anyone done either of these any tips on how i could get this working 
how can i run selenium grid from an ant build i m working on modifying our existing selenium grid setup so that it will work with selenium the process of setting up the hub and nodes seems to be much simpler but i m having a problem getting it running in an ant build the way i did before i ve read through the wiki on selenium grid and tried to set up the ant build accordingly my problem is that the first target runs starting the hub then the other targets do not run but the build completes i m attempting to run these on my own machine with selenium rc junit tests and testng as a test runner the targets i have are as follows it seems like the ant thread is finished after the first target runs i looked at a way to start them in a new window like the previous grid but i didn t see a way to do that except for the task i also tried running the hub in an task and the node as a task that resulted in the ant build stopping execution after the target as opposed to finishing is there a way i can get this running or is there a better way to accomplish it

what techniques are available for surgical adjustment of models of set theory suppose i have a model m of set theory zfc or whatever let s say that i want to take a set a out of it and still have a model of set theory for the sake of argument say a is one of the indefinable real numbers intuitively a is not required for m to be a model of set theory there are models of set theory without indefinable real numbers so we ought to be able to take it out the naive approach is to take m a with the induced membership relation and try to verify that it s still a model of set theory but it isn t e g m must contain a singleton a and in m a the singleton a is now empty so we have at least two empty sets violating extensionality probably this is hardly even the beginning of our problems we run into similar problems if we try to add a single new set to the model e g a new subset of the reals to add a single new set b we need to add a singleton b we need to add all finite sets containing b we need to modify sets produced by the separation axiom to include b where appropriate etc so in general doing this sort of fine grained surgery on a model of set theory is a difficult problem even when intuitively it should be possible i am wondering what techniques are available for this i understand that forcing is broadly speaking a method for adding more sets the omitting types theorem is one way to remove sets unfortunately i believe that none of the methods i know apply to the problem i am working on in particular i don t think forcing applies because my problem is one of removing sets not adding them and i don t think omitting types applies because meeting its hypotheses essentially seems to amount to already having solved the problem i am trying to solve so i am casting about for other methods question what other techniques are available for fine grained addition and removal of sets to from a model of set theory thank you

cakephp best way to handle asset minification combining i know that it s good to minify assets because doing so reduces their file size which reduces the amount of time it takes for the page to load i also know that it s good to combine assets because doing so reduces the number of http requests which once again reduces the amount of time it takes for the page to load this is important because there are still people on dial up and mobile devices often don t have a fast connection the thing i m struggling with is how to easily add asset minification and combining into my workflow i develop locally using cakephp and i use git for version control when it s time to go live i ssh into the server hosting the live site and merge in the latest commit here s how i would go about rolling my own solution only accounts for minification and is not tested my development environment s app config core php file would always have its debug level set to a value greater than and the production environment s would always be at on the file system all css and javascript would be stored in external files like so app webroot css used site wide css app webroot css used on a few pages css app webroot css used on one page css app webroot js used site wide js app webroot js used on a few pages js app webroot js used on one page js rather than using in the view file i would use this rather than using in the layout file i would use this finally i would set up git to create the minified assets whenever a commit is made using this setup i would be working with the unminified assets in development and the minified ones in production the thing is i don t want to re invent the wheel if i don t have to i believe that re inventing the wheel should only be done if you re solving a problem that is both significant and uncommon how do you all handle this thanks

virtualbox management interface unreliability i m using virtualbox ose with vms running and everything s going fine i find that if i hammer the vboxmanage interface all sorts of interesting things happen usually necessitating either a restart of the vm in question or of all vms for instance if i use to run processes after a few hours of using it maybe once or twice a minute on any given vm it ll mysteriously start reporting and refusing to do anything sometimes trying to restart on the vm itself will get it back in working order but often it won t and in the meantime no data can be collected using such data includes the vm s ip so if i hadn t recorded it earlier i m usually in trouble and have no option but to portscan the network for it or kill the vm s process on the host manually and restart it this one i haven t narrowed down yet but it seems that even using to retrieve a machine s ip frequently and rapidly is enough to cause all vms management interfaces to die the processes are still running fine but reports them all as powered off in the meantime another process somewhere in the system seems to have decided that their being powered off means they need to be powered on again and suddenly i have x the number of processes running than i used to has anyone else seen behaviour like this is there any workaround this is a serious impediment to my work as i ve had to resort to a lot of hacky caching of data and rate limiting how often i call just in case i accidentally bring vms to their knees

how to calculate the expected value when betting on which pairings will be selected i found a seemingly simple question in a popular book on probability a draw for a football cup is to be made there are n teams n of course being even so there will be n matches you can bet on the pairings of the actual matches you will get p for each correct guess e g if team a plays against team b and you guessed that you will get p the question is how much would you be prepared to offer for the right to make the n guesses this doesn t seem to be as easy as i thought it to be the reason for this is that on the one hand you will have binomial coefficients but there is another layer of complexity because you draw the matches without replacement so you have to deal with conditional probabilities and the last match will of course be fixed without further drawing but perhaps i am missing something and there is an easy way out is this a well known problem is it normally posed in a different form e g cards when not answering directly perhaps you ll have some references for me p s i slightly generalized the question in the book but i won t mention the title for the moment because the answer given there is not very well explained so it doesn t add any value

textview inside relativelayout in custom view not applying gravity correctly so i have a setup where i m creating my own view and i m adding some textviews into it however the gravity setting is broken for it it centers horizontally but not vertically i m doing it this way because there s other stuff i m also drawing within my view besides just the textviews but those work fine there s only a problem with the textview gravity here s partial code of what i have this draws the textviews in the exact spots and sizes that i want them i know because of the background color but the gravity sets them to be only centered horizontally not vertically yes the textviews are larger than the actual text strings i could probably implement the solution found here textview gravity but that doesn t seem like a very efficient or reliable way to get around this is there something i m doing wrong that s causing gravity to stop working correctly any input help is appreciated

efficient calculation of polynomial product i have polynomials p x ldots x n and p x ldots x n of which i have to compute the product with a special property the exponent of each variable is always either or where every exponent greater than gets cut down to e g x x x x x and the result of x x x x x x x x x would be x x x x x x x x x additionally values for all but one variables are given so the result would be some polynomial p x k ax k b currently i compute the product the usual way multiplying each summand of p with every summand in p and then apply the values for all known x i but since both polynomials easily contain summands each the algorithm iterates over elements which simply takes too much time my question is does there exists a more effective procedure to compute p x k

nesting reference type object in inner scope has no effect on garbage collection true or false i have been reading the garbage collection chapter from jeffrey richter s fine book clr via c there he illustrated an example of how the gc conceptually works how roots are marked by referring to a disassembly listing of native code emitted from the jit compiler from that example it occurred to me that nesting reference types in scope seems to have zero effect on expediting the garbage collection of the nested variable i wonder if i am understanding this correctly in any case consider these versions of code a nesting a reference type variable y in an inner scope b same as above except that x and y are in the same scope out of curiosity i checked the generated il code for both versions and they are the same q so this seems to imply that indeed scoping doesn t expedite garbage collection in any way is this correct note i know about the using statement but i m only curious about the behaviour on the gc of plain old scoping as illustrated in the examples above q if the answer to q is true then i am utterly perplexed by how a object lifetime is not determined by scope situation can possibly happen as described here http www curly brace com favorite html

wpf architecture confusion re routed commands events and gestures in learning wpf i ve been reading scads of books and web sites one thing that seems to keep evading me is how we are supposed to properly wire up routedcommands in one article the author pointed out that the codebehind for your xaml files is supposed to contain nothing more than the call to initializecomponent i can get behind that it makes the xaml file nothing more than a presentation document and satisifies my unholy craving for separation of concerns on the other hand every sample i ve seen that addresses double click events seems to want you to write code it was my understanding that we wanted to get away from having repetitive code in the codebehind files and again i m all for that so it seems to me that that s not the right way to do it the same is true of menu commands toolbar button clicks and so forth imagine for instance that i have a command to open a document that command has to present the open dialog then open the document and cache it in the application state this application only allows you to work on one document at a time the user can invoke this command by either choosing file open from the menu typing ctrl o clicking the open button on the toolbar if i trust most of the sources on the web i have to write at least two click event handlers that then invoke the command polluting the codebehind file that seems to me to defeat the purpose of having the commands i thought that i read somewhere that there was a way to bind the command to these things declaratively in xaml and it would do it for you even disabling the command if it couldn t execute but now i can t seem to find it nor a decent example of how to do it could someone please explain this to me it s all starting to look like voodoo and shrapnel at this point

use of fuzzy search when cross referencing data my department handles the collection and display of data from a wide range of intra company sources for use in data mining company dashboards one large challenge we have is cross referencing location names across various departments we are a rather large organization and departments with different interests do their own reporting for any one location in general there is alot of discrepancy in the exact name that a location name has in the reporting across those departments for instance a location may be referred to as the fabulous restaurant fabulous restaurant fabulous f amp b when the location goes through some renovation fabulous cafe or even profit center abc so my question is what best practices exist in reconciling these names in our own database and code let s assume for the moment that my department does not have the ability to unite the organization under a common hierarchy standard which would be the optimal solution at the moment our practice is to maintain ever growing reference tables of location names which are then referenced back into our own naming standard this allows us to maintain historical consistency with our data is it feasible advisable to implement some kind of fuzzy search when cross referencing locations something for instance that might ignore instances of words like the or treat cafe and restaurant equally based on some pre defined logic i certainly don t think we would ever be able to algorithmically account for all of the random naming conventions we encounter but is it enough to be able to account for some most of them

integrating feature request functionality directly into the business software you write what are relative merits of something like a button on a piece of custom bizware that says press me to ask for a feature or click here if something didn t work right the problem i m trying to remedy is the general lack of formality surrounding feature requests most specifically the rate at which i receive walk ups from end users taken one at a time it can be beneficial but sometimes it can hinder productivity on the larger scale has anyone done something like this and has it been a general success or alternately somewhat a waste of time my instincts are not giving me a hint here 
java enum why use tostring instead of name if you look in the enum api at the method it says that returns the name of this enum constant exactly as declared in its enum declaration most programmers should use the tostring method in preference to this one as the tostring method may return a more user friendly name this method is designed primarily for use in specialized situations where correctness depends on getting the exact name which will not vary from release to release why is better to use i mean tostring may be overridden when name is already final so if you use tostring and someone overrides it to return a hard coded value your whole application is down also if you look in the sources the tostring method returns exactly and just the name it s the same thing

where does domino server store synchronized address books we have a user whose profile was migrated from our local domino server to a server at our home office after she moved to a remote office her address book file locally stored in notes has been synchronized and she has access to all her contacts via her blackberry she is now using a thin client vdi setup at the new office and there are no addresses showing in her personal address book in notes helpdesk has no clue as usual except to suggest that i copy the address book database file from her old computer in our office to her network drive where notes is now configured problem with this is that i repurposed her computer already and so there is no local address book database file to copy but she has all contacts on her bb and so we no nothing is lost prior to moving she d synchronized her address book and so everything is up on a server somewhere so after fighting with the helpdesk she calls me and tells them what they told her and i suggest using synchonize address book on her new system in order to simply download the addresses to her client and local address book database when she attempts to do this she receives an error stating that only the database owner is allowed to do this which means i need to go to that database on the server and make sure the acl on the database agrees with her system configuration one problem i can t find where the sychronized address book databases are stored on a domino server do you know or is there something else entirely that i ought to be looking for or configuring to get this to work 
how to prevent downtime during aws elasticbeanstalk deployment of a new version of the app my understanding of elasticbeanstalk is that when you deploy a new version of your app that it deploys it to the ec instances one at a time if you have more than one however even with a minimum of two instances my application incurs a short amount of downtime when i upload a new war when it is deploying it as if it is updating them both simultaneously is there a way i can ensure there is no downtime and that one instance is fully updated and accepting requests before the next starts here is how the events look note this is with zero load on the app so it will only get worse with production traffic info environment update completed successfully info new application version was deployed to running ec instances error the application did not respond at the health check url info waiting for seconds while ec instances download the updated application version info deploying version somethingmore to instance s 
ajax form submit in jquery mobile a myth does jquery mobile even support ajax form submits this probably sounds like a ridiculous question but after fighting with it for hours and then checking the jquerymobile com docs i m starting to think that it doesn t i ll skip my own code and go right to jquerymobile com http jquerymobile com test docs forms forms sample html this page has a section called default ajax form example wherein the author very briefly tells us how jquery mobile handles ajax form submission in his her words jquery mobile will make sure that the url specified is able to be retrieved via ajax and handle it appropriately obviously lots of detail there and ironically the sample provided does not call results ajaxily it merely redirects to the results php script no ajax is performed the form is a standard html form with an action and method it looks like should behave exactly as it does redirecting to a new location somehow jqm is supposed to jump in and set up ajax automatically but it doesn t do that on my iphone or in safari firefox or chrome am i going crazy or is jqm simply incomplete and advertising this functionality falsely

non abelian p group abelian subgroups of index p i m trying to prove the following problem a let g be a non abelian p group with an abelian subgroup of index p then the number of abelian subgroups of g of index p is either or p in the latter case the center of g has index p b a nilpotent group of class and order has exactly one cyclic subgroup of index i ve made some progress towards a and tried to use a to show b but despite thinking about this for a few days i m missing something and i can t quite finish off my argument here is an outline of the main results that i have managed to show essentially i think i ve shown that for part a if there is more than one than there must be at least p assume that there is more than one abelian subgroup of index p let h and k be two of them then they are both maximal and hence normal in g and then g hk then i was able to show that h cap k leq z g and then it follows that z g has index p as g is non abelian so now i want to show that there are exactly p abelian subgroups of index p suppose l is a subgroup of g of index p containing h cap k then l lhd g since h cap k lhd g and it has index p then l h cap k is cyclic of order p from this i was able to show that l is abelian now consider g h cap k which has order p however it can t be cyclic since it has two subgroups of order p namely h h cap k and k h cap k so g h cap k cong c p times c p and it follows that it has p subgroups of order p this gives p subgroups of g of index p by the above each of these is abelian now i need to show that there can t be more than p such subgroups but i m a bit stuck here as for part b i thought i might be able to use a for this if i can show that there does exist an abelian group of order and it s cyclic somehow i need to use the fact that the group is of class i try looking at the upper and lower central series but can t see a way of applying them i would be grateful for any pointers in the right direction

modifying an existing module in linux kernel i am using as driver on my to pose it as mass storage for any usb host i have done that well now i need to do more is to capture eject event on usb device which is a functionality not given by till now i have got this in its is the routine that gets called when a windows usb host does i am thinking of adding a simple printk to send simple message in in function which i will watch from user space on but i m into a very basic kernel programming doubt if you can help me out i have written simple kernel modules which is lets say file an i use simple make command to compile it then to insert it and then i use it this is about a module totally written by me and i have also configured a module as option m in config file while recompiling kernel then i do make make modules make then we use to use that particular feature pl correct me if i am wrong but here this module is a kernel module if i make a change to it then can i just recompile it using its makefile and do modprobe but this makefile doesnt seem to support this idea will it interfere with already present copy of this module in running kernel or will i have to recompile kernel 
closure interior and boundary of jordan measurable sets this question has a number of parts let e subset mathbb r d be a bounded subset show that m star j e m star j bar e closure show that m star j e m star j e circ interior show that e is jordan measurable if and only if m star partial e i originally had different proofs for parts and but i revised them because i wanted a more rigorous epsilon estimate type proof i m trying to practice getting better at this but looking at them again i think there is a flaw in particular where i make the justification that we can fatten up or shrink down the covers in each part see the proofs basically the reason why i think it is now flawed is because if one replaces frac epsilon n by frac epsilon n the proof for the outer jordan measure part seems to carry over word for word in the case of lebesgue outer measure and that s clearly false since mu star cap mathbb q yet mu star overline cap mathbb q anyway i would appreciate anyone s assistance in helping me correct these proofs also for part i m stuck on proving the implication m star j partial e rightarrow e in mathscr j mathbb r d solution by definition of m star j there exists a collection of boxes b j j n such that both begin align e subset bigcup limits j n b j amp amp text and amp amp sum limits j n b j leq m star j e epsilon end align hold for every epsilon gt because e delta bar e subset e the set of limit points of e by enlarging each box b j as necessary we can find a new collection of boxes b j j n such that each of the conditions begin align b j leq b j leq b j frac epsilon n amp amp bigcup j n b j supset bar e supset e amp amp text and amp amp sum limits j n b j leq m star j bar e epsilon end align also holds for the same epsilon montonicity and the fact that e subset bar e then gives begin align m star j e amp leq m star j bar e amp leq sum limits j n b j amp leq sum limits j n left b j frac epsilon n right amp leq m star j e epsilon end align in particular we obtain the estimate bigg m star j e m star j bar e bigg leq epsilon and since epsilon was arbitrary we conclude m star j e m star j bar e as required solution by definition of m star j there exists boxes b j j n such that both begin align bigcup limits j n b j subset e amp amp text and amp amp sum limits j n b j geq m star j e epsilon end align hold for every epsilon gt because e delta e circ subset partial e subset e cup x in e n delta x cap e x forall delta gt and isolated points have inner and outer measure by shrinking each box b j as necessary we can find a new collection of boxes b j j n such each of the conditions begin align b j geq b j geq b j frac epsilon n amp amp bigcup limits j n b j subset e circ subset e amp amp text and amp amp sum limits j n b j geq m star j e circ epsilon end align also holds for the same epsilon montonicity and the fact that e circ subset e then gives begin align m star j amp geq m star j e circ amp geq sum limits j n b j amp geq sum limits j n left b j frac epsilon n right amp geq m star j e epsilon end align in particular we obtain the estimate bigg m star j e circ m star j e bigg leq epsilon and since epsilon gt was arbitrary we conclude m star j e m star j e circ as required solution we have the inequality m star j e m star j e circ leq m star j bar e m star j e in the case that e is jordan measurable this immediately becomes an equality m star j e m star j e circ m e m star j bar e m star j e and monotonicity then implies that m star j e delta bar e m star j e delta e circ which means that both bar e and e circ are jordan measurable with measure m e boolean closure then implies partial e is jordan measurable since partial e bar e e circ and from additivity we have m partial e m bar e m e circ now suppose partial e then sub additivity of m star j and m star j implies m star j star j partial e geq m star j star j bar e m star j star j e circ geq so that the original inequality is extended to m star j e circ m star j e m star j bar e leq m star j e circ m star j e m star j bar e comments update i want to look a little closer at my argument in i can t see why it s incorrect but perhaps a modification will make it more rigorous for convenience let s used cubes q j instead of boxes b j that the former can be used in the definition of jordan content is an easy consequence of the fact that any box b j can be arbitrarily approximated by a finite number of cubes by an obvious dissection process then i have a collection of cubes q j j n such that bigcup j n q j supset e and sum j n q j leq m star j e epsilon suppose each cube has some index length ell j and consider the cubes q j j n obtained by enlarging each ell j mapsto ell j frac epsilon n then this collection covers bar e for the following reasons if e has any isolated points then the q j already covered them so the q j certainly cover them as well therefore the only other points in bar e backslash e are limit points of the set e but limit points are arbitrarily close to e the set covered by the q j they have distance from the cover and since by the explicit construction dist q j q j frac epsilon n gt and q j also cover e we conclude the q j also cover bar e if this is wrong pleeaaassseee explain to me the logical fault then we have begin align m star j bar e amp leq sum j n q j amp sum j n left ell j frac epsilon n right d amp sum j n sum k d binom d k left ell j k left frac epsilon n right d k right amp sum j n left ell j d d frac epsilon n ell j d ldots frac epsilon d n d right amp sum j n q j no left frac epsilon n right amp leq m star j e o epsilon end align which shows that the outer measure of bar e is less than the outer measure of e i still don t know if this is fully rigorous or not though it still has the problem that the argument for outer lebesgue measure carries over by using ell j ell j frac epsilon j as each of the terms in the binomial expansion now are convergent infinite series and the result is still o epsilon moreover we would still also have dist q j q j frac epsilon j gt so i guess that basically proves there s something wrong with my logic i just don t know how to fix it update so i have concluded there is nothing inherently wrong with my argument just that it is incomplete for one thing you cannot conclude that an epsilon close countable covering of a set e can be epsilon fattened to produce a cover of bar e the counter example is cap mathbb q the reason for this somewhat peculiar fact is illustrated in this question i asked earlier today paradox as to measure of countable dense subsets but to put it summarily countable coverings allow you to circumvent density arguments in the sense that you can still cover e while avoiding bar e and in fact do so on a set of positive outer measure hence once epsilon is sufficiently small the fattened cubes will still fail to cover bar e that this cannot happen in the finite case is made rigorous in the following completely redone solutions to and actually fattening of the original cover of e is not even necessary as it is shown that a finite cover of e is necessarily a finite cover of bar e leading to a new characterization of outer jordan measure involving closed boxes only moreover we also obtain another surprising explanation as to why countable coverings can avoid this conclusion the main idea being that countable unions of closed sets need not be closed the same arguments apply in reverse for the case of inner jordan measure of e and e circ where it is shown that any containment by e is necessarily a containment by e circ hence leading to a new definition of inner jordan measure involving open boxes only it is interesting to note that countable containments cannot avoid this conclusion in contrast to the analogous situation for covers and this stems from the fact that countable unions of open boxes are open incidentally we conclude that nothing is gained by considering countable containments hence why we do not consider a lebesgue inner measure i will formulate this all into a complete answer once i prove let e subset mathbb r d be a bounded set by definition of m star j there exists a collection of boxes b j j n such that both begin align e subset bigcup limits j n b j amp amp text and amp amp sum limits j n b j leq m star j e epsilon end align hold for every epsilon gt now the definition of elementary measure implies m b j b j bar b j m b j and because bigcup j n bar b j supset e we may assume each b j is closed but this implies that the cover is itself closed since n is finite e g bigcup j n b j overline bigcup j n b j moreover as bar e is the emph smallest closed set which contains e we have that b j j n is an epsilon close cover of bar e as well it follows from monotonicity and the previous remarks that m star j e leq m star j bar e leq sum j n b j leq m star j e epsilon leq m star j bar e epsilon in particular we obtain the estimate bigg m star j e m star j bar e bigg leq epsilon and since epsilon was arbitrary we conclude m star j e m star j bar e as required by definition of m star j there exists a collection of boxes b j j n such that both begin align e supset bigcup limits j n b j amp amp text and amp amp sum limits j n b j geq m star j e epsilon end align hold for every epsilon gt now the definition of elementary measure implies m b j b j b j circ m b j circ and because e supset bigcup j n b circ j we may assume each b j is open but this implies that the contained set is itself open e g bigcup j n b j left bigcup j n b j right circ moreover as e circ is the emph largest open set which is contained in e we have that b j j n is an epsilon close set contained in e circ as well it follows from monotonicity and the previous remarks that m star j e geq m star j e circ geq sum j n b j geq m star j e epsilon geq m star j e circ epsilon in particular we obtain the estimate bigg m star j e m star j e circ bigg leq epsilon and since epsilon was arbitrary we conclude m star j e m star j e circ as required some remarks these results allow us to redefine m star j as the infimal elementary measure of a cover of e by a finite number of closed boxes and m star j as the supremal elementary measure of a containment by e consisting of finite numbers of open boxes these characterizations are are just as valid for countable coverings and containments however to obtain the conclusion from finiteness of the cover is essential the issue is that a countable union of closed boxes need not be closed and so we can not conclude that the outer measures of e and bar e coincide when countable covers are permitted the set a cap mathbb q is a typical example of how the conclusion of can fail when countable coverings are allowed the lebesgue outer measure of a is since it can be covered by a countable union of degenerate boxes while the jordan outer measure of a is since bar a on the other hand no problem occurs when finite containments are upgraded to countable containments this is because a countable union of open boxes is always open and so the lebesgue inner measure of e must still coincide with the lebesgue inner measure of e circ since e circ is the largest open set contained in e moreover every open set mathscr o is the countable union of pairwise disjoint boxes and by being a union of such boxes as opposed to an intersection we see that every finite subcollection of such boxes is contained in mathscr o it is easy to see then that the inner jordan and lebesgue measures of mathscr o coincide and the conclusion from implies that they agree for all sets incidentally this demonstrates our lack of need for an inner lebesgue measure in fact littlewood s characterization of lebesgue measurable sets being nearly open is basically equivalent to showing that the inner and outer lebesgue measures are equal in any case clearly nothing is gained by upgrading finite containments to countable ones 
how make white on black text not bleed i have been in a lot of pain finding a good equivalent of notepad when switching to mac and i still miss it a lot because it features a lot of different keyword thanks to scintilla which smultron xcode and textwrangler don t example int and for are colored the same but they are not the same kind of statement even xcode doesn t use enough keywords but i m going to stop whining about those nerdish nightmares i configure my text editor to use bright text on a black background and so far i use profont at pt which is really much readable even at this really small size while being a bitmap font i wanted to switch to another truetype font menlo or inconsolata but i went with some problem the glyphs appear to bleed with white text on black background it might be the algorithm osx uses to draw fonts but it looks like a bold typeface and is less readable is there any way to solve this problem why can t i find any good scintilla using editor on mac what a big trouble for my nerdish sensitivity 
jframe getting actual content size i know it s likely this has already been asked but i couldn t find a question it could be because i m wording this wrongly so i decided to ask i just made a jframe in java of course and it s giving me the wrong size well technically it s the right size but it s including the windows borders around the edges and the bar at the top with the minimise maximise and close buttons title bar how can i get or prefferably even set the size but force it to ignore that so that i get the actual inside content at that side rather than the entire window sorry if i m confusing i m not the best at wording questions

dynamic sql statement return value using the current target connection i m currently creating my first real life project in pervasive the task is to map a certain xml structure containing orders as in shops and products to tables i created myself these tables rest inside a ms sql server instance all of the tables have a unique key called id an automatically incremented column i ve dropped this column from all mappings so that pervasive will not try to fill it itself for certain calculations for a split key in one of the tables and for references to the created records in other tables i will need the id that the database has just created for that i have googled the answer i can use select identity as a statement and this returns the id that has most recently been created for the current connection this means that in pervasive i will have to execute this statement using the already existing target connection object but how to do that i am quite sure that i will need a jdimport or djexport object but how to get one associated with the current connection that pervasive inserts the records by or is there any other way to handle this auto increment when i need to reference the id in other tables

do cfls have a significant impact on your light bill i just moved into my own apartment and i ve taken quite an interest in being as energy efficient as possible simply because hey i m paying the electricity bill now i ve been wondering are compact fluorescent lamp cfls as efficient as they claim to be i detest the light that they give off but if they re significantly cheaper to use especially in contrast to how expensive they are in comparison to normal bulbs then i might be persuaded to pick up a few i work almost constantly so i probably don t use more than or hours of electric light daily anyway so is it worth the investment and inconvenience i m just a bit skeptical of something that claims to save me money by being times the cost of the alternative 
why does sendkey send only work once in a while i m making a windows application that captures keyboard input globally when a user uses the ctrl alt g shortcut combo the application uses to type a generaged guid into whatever text field is in focus and it should do this regardless of the application taking the input it works exactly as i intended the first time you type ctrl alt g but subsequent attempts result in nothing or just very infrequent successes i mean it all should be very simple and consistent i have a working global keyboard hook which works all the time i ve tested it but the sendkey send method doesn t work every time i ve looked all over google at anything related to my issue but nothing has worked so far anyone have any insight edit i ve tried using sendkey sendwait as well does the same thing i really want a more responsive way to generate new guid using this keyboard shortcut approach edit below is the essential parts of the code the event code is quite simple everything else in my project is just fluff update i do have more questions about this subject but i am out of time to continue working on this for today i have implemented jon raynor s suggestion of using the app config approach to some degree of success once i isolate my new problems i ll post an edit and possibly close this question if i get my application functioning as intended 
running quicktest pro tests from maven jenkins i need to leverage quicktest pro from our maven jenkins builds i know i know qtp is not the best tool out there i m amused by the bag of flaming dog poo reference but our qe team is using it and i want to run some of their tests in jenkins a has anyone used this specific combination an example maven plugin would be great since i doubt that is likely lets break it up into pieces a how do you simply launch a qtp test from the command line i think i can figure the rest of the launching part of things out using antrun or something like that b the results format from qtp doesn t appear to be a standard like surefire reports i don t know either well so i might be wrong can you give me some guidance on getting report results back into maven jenkins i m thinking that may involve parsing the qtp results file

breaking readfile blocking named pipe windows api to simplify this is a situation where a namedpipe server is waiting for a namedpipe client to write to the pipe using writefile the windows api that is blocking is readfile the server has created the synchronous pipe no overlapped i o with blocking enabled the client has connected and now the server is waiting for some data in the normal flow of things the client sends some data and the server processes it and then returns to readfile to wait for the next chunk of data meanwhile an event occurs user input for example and the namedpipe server must now execute some other code which it cannot do while the readfile is blocking at this point i need to mention that the namedpipe client is not my application so i have no control over it i cannot make it send a few bytes to unblock the server it is just going to sit there and send no data since i do not have control of the client implementation i cannot change anything on that end one solution would be to create a separate thread in which all readfile operations are performed that way when the event occurs i can just process the code the problem with that is that the event also requires a separate thread so now i have two additional threads for each instance of this server since this needs to be scalable this is undesirable from another thread i have tried calling and they both will not return until the client writes to the pipe i cannot connect to the same pipe and write a few bytes because all instances of a named pipe share the same pipe name but each instance has its own buffers and handles and provides a separate conduit for client server communication http msdn microsoft com en us library aa aspx i need a way to fake it out so the k dollar question is how can i break the blocking of readfile 
model fetch not firing any event i ve created one backbone model called artist and one backbone view called artistview i sucessfully fetched the model as i could see it in my chrome devtools network tab however fetch didn t fire any change event at that moment the weird thing is that it fired well a change event when it created the model but not when it fetched this one i could use the success callback in the fetch method but i feel this is not the most proper way to do that any idea model amp view initialization i then fetch my model in my backbone view class i listen to the change event coming from the model edit sync event isn t working either when i create the model it fires well a sync event but not when the model has been successfully fetched 
cfiledialog s current directory inconsistent in exe and dll normally when you use cfiledialog to open a file multiple times current directory is maintained i e each time the dialog opens at the directory where previous dialog ended if it was not cancelled and this works even if you use different instances of cfiledialog from different places and even after program is restarted the previous directory is maintained but it looks like in my app this doesn t work across dll cfiledialogs called from main exe program have their current dir and cfiledialogs from dll have another one they don t interact with each other but otherwise behave normally so i end up with two inconsistent current directories and you have to navigate to required location again from dll and sometimes you forget to change dir and you load some data in exe from one dir and some other data in dll from another dir and gets weird results do you know a method to have the same current dir when opening cfiledialog from exe and dll clarification i don t want the dialogs to always start from the same dir i want them to retain last used dir but do it consistently in exe and dll my exe is created in vs dll in vs my initial guess was that you need to provide the main window handle in cfiledialog constructor in dll but this didn t help my next guess is to manually get current directory via well getcurrentdirectory and set it as a starting location for dll s cfiledialog and then set current dir to where it ended but this looks quite ugly and i m not sure it will work in all oses from winxp to win because they have different rules for default directory of cfiledialog according to msdn

is it true that in most object oriented programming languages an i in an instance method always refers first to local and then to global but never to the instance variable or class variable in the following code what is being alerted the answer is at the end of this question i found that the in the alert call either refers to any local if any or the global variable there is no way that it can be the instance variable or the class variable even when there is no local and no global defined to refer to the instance variable we need and to the class variable we need is this actually true for almost all object oriented programming languages any exception are there cases that when there is no local and no global it will look up the instance variable and then the class variable scope or in this case are those called scope the answer is is being alerted

sql server how to use dense rank on one column based on order by another column i have got a table in sql server where i need alternating values for one column say column duplicates in that column always need the same value hence i was thinking about using the function for this column via but there are also zip codes in that table that i need to order the data by before assigning the alternating values so basically after the alternating values based on column have been assigned when the data is then ordered by zip code the alternating values really need to be alternating apart from the duplicates in the alt table of course currently i get a result where the values do get alternating values but when ordering by zip codes i have sequences of e g via the dense rank function that are the problem i tried using a temp table but didn t get the expected result with a and then doing the desk rank on that table because the order of a temp table isn t guaranteed any ideas are greatly appreciated cheers stevo edit sample code the problem now is that when ordered by zip code the following columns both contain the same value as alternating value when ordered by zip code the result should really have alternating values but these alternating values should be based on the column baseforalternatingvalue the expected outcome should be the last alternatingvalue of the last two result rows is different the alternating value needs to alternate between different zip codes before it was for the third last row and also for the second last row as for mikael s question below and what if you have add row cccccccccc what would the expected output be then the expected output would then be so in summary i need alternating values for the column baseforalternatingvalue but this alternating should be visible when ordering by zip code and duplicates in baseforalternatingvalue need the same alternating value in the end i found a simpler and relatively nice solution using a temp table with an insert into and order by and using id values id values will reflect the order by clause finding out the smallest id for a given baseforalternatingvalue finding out the count of distinct baseforalternatingvalues with an id smaller than that

reliable file copy move process mostly unix linux short story we have a need for a rock solid reliable file mover process we have source directories that are often being written to that we need to move files from the files come in pairs a big binary and a small xml index we get a ctl file that defines these file bundles there is a process that operates on the files once they are in the destination directory that gets rid of them when it s done would rsync do the best job or do we need to get more complex long story as follows we have multiple sources to pull from one set of directories are on a windows machine that does have cygwin and an ssh daemon and a whole pile of directories are on a set of sftp servers most of these are also windows our destinations are a list of directories on aix servers we used to use a very reliable perl script on the windows cygwin machine when it was our only source however we re working on getting rid of that machine and there are other sources now the sftp servers that we cannot presently run our own scripts on for security reasons we can t run the copy jobs on our aix servers they have no access to the source servers we currently have a homegrown java program on a linux machine that uses sftp to pull from the various new sftp source directories copies to a local tmp directory verifies that everything is present then copies that to the aix machines and then deletes the files from the source however we re finding any number of bugs or poorly handled error checking none of us are java experts so fixing improving this may be difficult concerns for us are with a remote source sftp will rsync leave alone any file still being written some of these files are large from reading the docs it seems like rysnc will be very good about not removing the source until the destination is reliably written does anyone have experience confirming or disproving this additional info we will be concerned about the ingestion process that operates on the files once they are in the destination directory we don t want it operating on files while we are in the process of copying them it waits until the small xml index file is present our current copy job are supposed to copy the xml file last sometimes the network has problems sometimes the sftp source servers crap out on us sometimes we typo the config files and a destination directory doesn t exist we never want to lose a file due to this sort of error we need good logs if you were presented with this would you just script up some rsync or would you build or buy a tool and if so what would it be or what technologies would it use i and others on my team are decent with perl 
converting from div to table or parsing pdf in php i m developing a webapp in which i take an invoice converted from pdf to html then parse the invoice lines i have a in my main window which displays the contents but when i display the contents from the invoice in that all the contents appear overlapped in the converted invoice there is no table only with absolute positioning i can t make it any other way at least with this aproach because that s the way the converter works so as a solution i m converting from div to table trying to decide when there is a change of row or not based on the top parameter from the corresponding div however besides the invoice data i also have the invoice header i m having difficulties to decide if the table is the same or not but so far i think the solution passes through making tables one for the company logo one for the header and one for the data but i need all these tables to appear in the correct positions and with the correct sizes at the moment i m not allowed to paste invoice examples and as i m stuck in an early stage close to the algorithm stage i don t think any examples of my code and of the invoices could help anyone to understand the situation better but i promise to update this with examples soon as an alternative solution i could parse the pdf myself but i haven t found a way to do it so far i m using php to make the webapp and verypdf pdf html to make the conversion i know with that little information is hard to get help any ideas are welcome 
is there an elegant way to add multiple html classes with xslt let s say i m transforming a multiple choice quiz from an arbitrary xml format to html each choice will be represented as an html tag in the result document for each choice i want to add an html of to the if that choice was the correct answer additionally if that choice was the one selected by the user i want to add a class of to the consequently if the choice is the correct one as well as the submitted one the should have a of as far as i know white space separated attribute values aren t a part of the xml data model and thus cannot directly be created via xslt however i have a feeling there s a better way of doing this than littering the code with one conditional for every possible combination of classes which would be acceptable in this example but unwieldy in more complex scenarios how can i solve this in an elegant way example of desired result

c recommended way to check if a sequence is empty a method returns a sequence and you now want to check if it is empty how do you recommend doing that i m looking for both good readability and good performance the first and most obvious way is to check that the count is greater than zero has decent readability but terrible performance since it has to actually go through the whole sequence a method that i sometimes use is the following this doesn t as far as i know have to go through the whole sequence but the readability is a bit backwards and awkward reads a lot better if we are checking that the sequence is not empty though another option is to use in a try catch like this not a very pretty solution and probably slower too since it is using exceptions and stuff could prevent that by using of course except you would have a big problem if the first item in the sequence actually was the default value so any other ways to check if a sequence is empty which one do you usually use which one do you recommend to use note for optimal readability i would probably put one of the above snippets in an extension method but i am still curious since i would have to do something inside that method as well p

anyone seen this com error number when calling querystatevariable from upnp dll although i am using vb below i m happy to accept solutions in vb net or c as i can write in both i am trying to use the function querystatevariable which takes only one argument a string describing the name of the variable you want to retreive the value for so you run it like this service object is correctly set to upnpservice wanipconnection this is occuring under the wanipconnection service which is directly under the wan connection device i can only read out of of the state variables and i m just using externalport as an example variable name every other variable returns this error number with the generic failed description message namely at the moment i m just ignoring it ignoring the exception and returning an empty string but if anyone has any idea on what this could mean or even just a lead i can follow up on it would be a great help perhaps someone knows what this error number means or is refering to or has anyone seen this or is getting this error number or has come across it before it may have a generic meaning in the com world but i was unable to pinpoint it on google if you search google for there are no hits if you remove the sign there are several but all pointing to different meanings and if you put the word upnp next to it you get hits now if you search for upnp without the quotes of course you get a wopping hits and that s almost entirely users running into errors using upnp enabled software and copying pasting their error logs it isn t programmers reporting the error numbers and asking for help and receiving solutions or answers would have been great update i have found the definition of this error code but still am no closer to solving it as the description is very generic and doesn t provide me with any leads in how to go about resolving it but for your information here it is maybe it makes more sense to some of you definition of upnp e device error the variable is not evented and the remote query returned an error code this is not a transport error the device received the request but it returned an error additional text written below is not necessary reading to interpret this question but included for those interested in additional information i ve produced a log from my program as output so i can paste the results for each of the variables and attempts to get their values into stackoverflow just to recap wanipconnection service has variables so i ve tried and logged all of them with only successful attempts rest are runtime errors and the wanpppconnection service which is really similar to the wanipconnection service but has a total of state variables just more than wanipconnection i have tried and logged all variable retreival attempts and have received only successful value returns all others ending up in a runtime error so i ve gotten successes from both the wanipconnection and wanpppconnection here are my logs my real ip address changed because i know i will get flamed if i didn t lol and the currently set device amp service is stated shown at the start of each of the two logs here it is note to avoid confusion i place star symbols around retreived values to visualize whitespaces sometimes stackoverflow turns the contents into italics or leaves the stars in place if string in between is empty first

dual space is a vector space i was wondering if some one could please shed some light on why or how a dual space itself becomes a vector space over the field the finite dimensional vector spaces book by paul halmos states to every vector space v we make correspond the dual space v consisting of all the linear functionals on v the book goes on to present the defining property of a linear functional and the definition of the linear operations for linear functionals also for the sake of completion a linear functional is defined by the text as a linear functional on a vector space v is a scalar valued function y defined for every vector x with the property that identically in the vectors x and x and the scalar alpha and alpha y left alpha x alpha x right alpha y left x right alpha y left x right based on these definitions is n t v composed of scalar valued functions with the above property i fail to see any vectors present in v yet the book later assumes that we must know that and starts defining a dual space v of a dual space v of a vector space v any help would be much appreciated

c dm broadcast receiver i had a working c dm application i reused the same package name when creating a new c dm application it works except now the broadcastreceiver doesn t get called when the application is not running that is to say it all works if i run the application and send it c dm messages but after a force quit the broadcastreceiver is no longer called i have looked at a lot of examples and compared everything in my old manifest to the new one paying extra attention to package names used in categories intent services etc question is there a common c dm coding config mistake that results in the broadcastreceiver not being called after an app is force quit i do get this log cat when i send a c dm message after force quit of my application warn gtalkservice datamsgmgr broadcast intent callback result cancelled forintent act com google android c dm intent receive cat com aawwpcd pcd has extras i get one of those for each c dm message i send to the device after force quitting the application it looks like the intent is coming in but not being passed to my broadcastreceiver edit here are the relavant bits from the manifest and broadcastreceiver broadcastreciever manifest edit could this be something new in x as stated above my problems started with this new application written for x what i want is for the c dm to call the broadcastreceiver even when the application is not running i am not seeing that could it be a x change it worked this way before on x phones and i can t find anything i am doing different it will be a hassle to write the test code to prove this but that s next i guess edit seems related to force quit i don t have any problem when i re install the apk and then send the device a c dm message the broadcast receiver picks it up in this case the application was not already running when the c dm came in yet everything worked as expected the only problem i am having is after i force quit an application c dm messages after that are not picked up by the broadcastreceiver 
how to set include path in xcode project i am trying to use a c library in an objective c xcode project the libraries directory structure is as follows the library s docs say to include file h and file h includes file h and file h i am getting file not found errors for the includes of file h and file h they are included by file h in the following manner i read here that these angle brackets instruct the preprocessor to search for include files along the path specified by the include environment variable as opposed to searching in the same directory as the file that contains the include so i added the include environment variable in xcode by going to product edit scheme and set it to however i am still getting the file not found errors the files are successfully included if i change file h to include them like this but i d rather not do that for every file in the library how can i fix this

windows server r server vps every connection capped at kb s i have a strange problem on a windows server r server based vps my provider gives me unmetered and unlimited bandwidth and obviously full root access i administer the machine via rdp without using any web interface to have complete control i noticed something very odd because i see that every single connection http ftp mail etc seems limited to kb s so if i try to download a file via http i go to kb s if i download a second one that one gets another kb s and so on till i fill the maximum connection of my cable connection from home mbit s so from the server i can get a total of almost mb s but every single connection arrives top to kb s i tried the same test via ftp on the same server and in upload and download i get the same results one download or upload max kb s if i start another one that one as well is up to kb s and so on the same thing happens if i try to send a big file or download something big via email imap and smtp i checked all the single server services and i can t find any limit in their configurations and as far as i know windows firewall cannot limit the bandwidth this way any suggestion about how to test more this problem or how to solve it i find it very odd and the provider as well

how do you stress test your hard drives when looking for large new drives tb on newegg and the like i note a number of reviews talking about drives being either d o a or hitting the click of death or even releasing the magic smoke within a week or so of use a portion of the reviews mention this phenomenon whether the drive in question is western digital or hitachi or whatever for those of you using windows what do you to place a large initial stress on the drive to see if it can take it for how long test the drive afterwards presumably with some sort of s m a r t tool or others to see if any negative changes have been noted note this is one component of a larger plan for both high availability and backups for my home data

why does an instance of a program sometimes not merge with his icon on the taskbar allow me to explain by showing you this picture as you can see it is a picture of my windows taskbar no modifications made now let s take a look at the right active icons you have navicat the greenish icon running note that it has windows open next is notepad i ve opened instances of notepad as you can see it s grouped together now for my last one netbeans the blue cube only this time after opening netbeans by clicking on the taskbar shortcut it opens next to the icon instead of merging with it like we ve seen with navicat and notepad if i click the left one the shortcut it simply opens the already running netbeans and if i click the right one the active instance it behaves exactly the same it simply opens up the already running instance why is this application not merging with the taskbar how can i let it merge and why doesn t it let me open up multiple instances of netbeans when i click the shortcut please provide me with a way to at least solve the merging problem as a perfectionist i can t sleep at night because of this brutal flaw within the taskbar ps i already tried middle clicking the icon to open up a new instance but it s not working 
how to return all database rows with certain field value hey i have a database table called projects with the fields id locationid name and year i query the database to retrieve all the values and store them in data before passing them into the relevant view in what part of the website i have created a timeline made of list items generated with a foreach in this timeline i was to associate projects with their corresponding year value so under i would find all the projects for right now i have an ugly hacked solution where inside the foreach which i use to generate the timeline i have another foreach that goes through the projects table and checks to see if the year field matches the current timeline year and if so adds it is there a more elegant way to query the data i passed into the view and therefore database field values based on finding specific strings essentially if i could write it how i want to express it i m looking for something like this

handleerror with strongly typed partial view i ran into a small roadblock this morning with handleerror users are directed properly to the views shared error aspx this view uses a master page which also displays just fine it also logs the particulars of the viewdata model exception in its page load method an acceptable use of codebehind in my opinion my problem is this the page contains a strongly typed partial view that contains some of the user s input data i would like to retain access to that data even after the exception occurs so the user isn t doubly penalized for our exception being presented with an error message and losing their form values is there a way to accomplish this using handleerror or another reusable attribute

spring mvc json producer takes too long in some cases background my application is a web based application using spring release jackson details i have a simple class lets call it myclass that stores something like an int a string and a byte i do a http call that invokes the method below the byte array is filled by my service layer via my dao layer with the binary content stored in a database imagine a small text file content which works fine iow myobj is constructed well the issue is that it takes very long to get the result in a browser example kb minutes if i stream the file directly code below it is really fast like sec for sure i would expect that the first approach to be slower but not at this difference i ve tried to somehow improve the serialization using a custom objectmapper no luck it is worth perhaps saying that if i serialize myobj of type myclass ignoring the byte everything works fine fast answer check the serializer below and i am registering my serializer to summarize what i am looking for is a fast faster response to getmyobj call considering that myobj stores a byte array any ideas suggestions thank you 
all possible combinations of x letters what is this called in mathematics firstly thank you for looking at my question i would like to know what this kind of problem is called in mathematics given a set of letters find all possible words you can make with those letters for example for abc the solution would be a b c ab ac abc ba bac bca ca cab cba some background i am writing a computer program to play scrabble and need to generate all possible words given from a set of letters i m researching algorithms for this problem but couldn t quite figure out what the general name is for this type of problem i m curious to find out so i thought i would ask i thought this was a type of permutation problem but reading up on permutations i see that the length of the result is set not variable and it s not a combination since the order matters

visual studio find all references and refactoring stopped working i am working with a fairly complex solution in visual studio it contains web applications class libraries a console application a msi setup project these are all written in c the long and the short of it is that find all references find symbols and some parts of refactoring do not work anymore i needed to investigate why a property on one of the classes in a class library was not being set when it should have been so i did a find all references and it found only some of the references only the ones within the project that contains the class in question i know for a fact that there are a bunch in one of the web application when it is doing the search i can see that it is searching all the projects in the solution i get the same problem when i do a find symbols and if i try to use the rename function of the refactoring i can work around these limitation by using standard find and replace or by commenting out the relevent section of code and picking through the post build errors it seems to be solution related as it also happens on my coleagues copy of visual studio for the same solution it is not limited to a particular property or class it seems to happen all over the place the only consistency is that it only ever seems to fins references within the project that they are declared a good example of this is that i can locate a reference within the web app right click and say find all references and if the it returns results i e it doesn t even find the reference i right clicked on tl dr find all references only finds references withon the project that they are declared if anyone can point me in the right direction with this that would be very helpful 
optimal data structure to access items near the highest value i m working on something where i have to store a fairly large number of items on the order of a few thousand items will be inserted deleted and accessed with high frequency however the larger an item s value the more likely it is to be inserted deleted or accessed furthermore i want to support very quick sorting of the first k items in the structure where k is fairly small so ideally the cost of doing these operations will be directly correlated to their value a plain old linked list where items are always kept sorted would be the naive approach here but performance in all cases is still important i would ideally like operations to be better than o n in the general case i ve brainstormed quite a bit on this issue and i m stumped i thought at first that a beap might be the ideal data structure but searches aren t biased towards the top of the beap they instead start at a bottom corner and work their way over and upwards not what i need a binary search tree of some flavor doesn t seem to be the right solution because although these operations are o log n i d like to do better for larger values what i need is almost a binary search tree flipped on its side so that i can start traversals from the lower right but i m trying to wrap my head around that to see if it would even work for me i think it would provide o log n worst case performance and better than o log n for larger values but i m not entirely sure is there such a data structure or would i have to invent one

concurrent hashmap iterator how safe is it for threading i used concurrent hashmap for creating a matrix it indices ranges to k i have created threads each of the thread access those elements of matrices and modifies to that and write it back of the matrix as i did not found it thread safe values are frequently returned as null and my program is getting crashed is there any other way to make it thread safe or this is thread safe and i have bug in some other places one thing is my program does not crash in single threaded mode 
asynchronous queue manager i ve run into a problem while writing an async multi server network app in c i have many jobs being taken care of by the thread pool and these include the writes to the network sockets this ended up allowing for the case where more than one thread could write to the socket at the same time and discombobulate my outgoing messages my idea for getting around this was to implement a queue system where whenever data got added to the queue the socket would write it my problem is i can t quite wrap my head around the architecture of something of this nature i imagine having a queue object that fires an event on whenever data gets added to the queue the event then writes the data being held in the queue but that won t work because if two threads come by and add to the queue simultaneously even if the queue is made to be thread safe events will still be fired for both and i ll run into the same problem so then maybe someway to hold off an event if another is in progress but then how do i continue that event once the first finishes without simply blocking the thread on some mutex or something this wouldn t be so hard if i wasn t trying to stay strict with my block nothing architecture but this particular application requires that i allow the thread pool threads to keep doing their thing any ideas

do higher order functions provide more power to functional programming my original question was is kappa calculus less powerful than lambda calculus does the lack of higher order functions on a programming language excludes some programs that could only be written in functional programming and therefore in a turing machine by powerful i mean a turing complete programming language for example a language that can not contain infinite recursive expressions ie infinite recursion or an infinite loop is not as powerful as lambda calculus and turiung machines since it would otherwise be a contradiction to the halting problem i can t find the reference right now byt i remember something about an algorithm that on a non lazy functional programming language has an omega n log n complexity while the same algorithm in imperative programming is omega n

onpaint event during a callback when the form is below imagine the following scenario now onepanelinthisform draws correctly when the form loads but if someeventocurred is fired from someform the paint event is not fired if i close and reopen the form it correctly repaints if i add a button to the form that executes onepanelinthisform invalidate the panel is correctly repaint what am i missing update clarification why don t we do this in the first place i have a form a this form a has a panel that overrides the paint event it s a standard winform in the paint it draws a circle this works turns out that form a has a button that opens form b but before doing that it subscribes to a custom event in form b called someevent see the sample above so form b can tell form a about someevent now form b is also a normal winform and it has a normal button in the click event of that button it opens form c form c also has an event called someevent and obviously form b subscribes to that event exactly like before the idea is that form c has a button that will trigger that event notifying the interested subscribers in this case when form c fires the event form b is subscribed and interested when form b receives the call back the only thing it does is notify the interested parties in this case form a that the event was fired now even while form c is still the top form the callstack goes back to forma to the method defined as callback from the st event this code executes all it does is really somepanel invalidate or refresh same results a breakpoint in the paint method of that panel reveals that the code doesn t get called no paint event is raised despite being invalidated i assume that happens because the form and therefore the panel is actually covered by formb and formc still open and that s all if i close form c and then form b form a still doesn t raise the paint event i ve tried invalidating the panel on form activation but that doesn t happen if i close the form a and reopen it the drawing is of course correct hope this makes it more clear there isn t really much code as this is pretty simple form a b c fire event b a invalidate

live rsync directory monitor for windows right now we have a central linux server and several satellite windows servers dispersed around the region every minutes the linux server rsyncs files from the others which are running the cwrsync daemon via cygwin however the directory tree on one of them is now topping gb and files this is taking considerably longer than fifteen minutes just to scan the directory for changes the actual transit time is miniscule in comparison to the scanning is there anything for windows that would monitor a particular tree and transmit any changes live or queue them up to transmit every few minutes without having to do a bulk scan of the entire tree every time and do this to a linux system preferably via rsync lsyncd seemed right for it until i realized it was for linux not windows

trouble with event stoppropagation onclick jquery i wrote this piece of code several years ago and at the time it works in ff amp chrome but now it results in an infinite loop in chrome you can run the code here http jsfiddle net py mu basically what its supposed to do is if the user clicks inside the div i e header it finds the link within it and invokes a click on it on chrome that invoked click also propagates back to the parent which in turn starts the whole process again i know i should be using less obtrusive javascript but this stems from an old rails app upgrade will hopefully come soon enough any idea why the event doesn t actually stop propagating technically the code should work without the stoppropagation call as the if statement inside the function should stop subsequent calls from firing apparently chrome does not update the currenttarget when programmatically invoking a click

vc dimension of cylinders within a cylinder i wish to know the vc dimension of a range space x mathcal r constructed as follows x is the cylinder x y z in mathbb r x y leq the ranges in mathcal r are formed by taking the union of circular disks such that the plane containing the disk is orthogonal to the z axis we stack the disks in the z direction a disk is tangent to the cylinder boundary at the point z a disk has diameter f z where f z is bounded strictly by lt f z lt and strictly monotonically increasing strictly monotonically decreasing or constant any set constructed by rotating one of these ranges about the z axis by an arbitrary angle is also a range intuitively imagine taking a set of coins circular of course and sorting them by diameter either decreasing or increasing then drop them carefully into a tube the main cylinder in that order so each rests on the last now tip the tube slightly so that they all rest against the side of the cylinder if our coins had zero thickness and we had one for every real number this would be our range i m mostly interested in the case that f z is sigmoid like the error function or tanh specifically i m interested in the cylindrical ranges formed by the family of functions tanh alpha z beta where alpha beta in mathbb r i know that this range space has at least vc dim i can construct a set of four points that it shatters but i m interested in putting an upper bound on it and understanding why i know that circular disks in mathbb r have vc dim subsets of the strip leq y leq subset mathbb r that are bounded above or below by tanh alpha z beta have at least vc dim probably equal to because the slope part of the tanh function acts much like a line is there any way to combine these facts to obtain an upper bound on the vc dimension is there anything to say about general f z that meet the criteria in

if else branchs and position of the return statement in a function whose entire logic falls along the lines of if this condition is true false return this else return this what is the best or perhaps most accepted form for this to take there seem to be ways i ve seen this makes the most sense but i ve once read that a function with a return type should never have it s return type located in a branch why the source never said so then there s this that has a return type outside of a branch but it takes away some of the meaning of the code i think and i ve also read there s benefits to if else blocks what those are the source didn t say either finally there s this the meaning is there return is outside of a branch but at the addition of a variable and code that wasn t really needed for the functionality my question is which of these three forms or any other form if there is one would be the best way to write a function in this vein

compute altitude and azimuth from cmattitude using either roll pitch and yaw or quaternion or rotation matrix i am struck with a problem i want to convert the cmattitude information of an iphone to altitude to deg and azimuth to deg i have googled around and hit some threads which discuss about it but none of threads turn out with a positive answer and most of the articles discussing quaternion and euler angles are too much mathematics to stuff into my brain is there some open source material which does this task easy or someone has written code to perform this conversion edit first off sorry for being so abstract azimuth is the direction on the surface of the earth towards which the device is pointing like north deg north east deg east deg south deg and so on ranges between deg to deg altitude is the angle made from the plane of the earth to an object in the sky thanks raj

what is the accepted practise for returning from boolean methods okay this is a simple question but i d like some oppinions on the correct practice here i am not looking at this for performance concerns because cpu s are so powerful that this wouldn t make any perceivable difference unless called without a looping contruct with thousands of iterations i just want views on what is the accepted standard i have a method that bascially just does a check returns a boolean however there are numerous ways to implement this here is how i would normally implement this however it is often frowned upon to return from the middle of a method the only time i normally do this is when performing a check on a form submission like this i consider that acceptable back to the undo question an alternative way to code it would be this this however unncessarily allocates a variable and is more verbose code another option would be this is more streamlined as it gets rid of the else however if the value is true is makes an unneccesary assignment by initializing it to false

multiple preg replace on the same variable while delving into some old code i ve stumbled upon a function which is used to clean up special characters using very excessively unfortunatly there s no way to avoid this cleanup the messed up data arrive from outside alot of those lines are in there and all do the same using different characters so there should be a better way to do this my first iteration to optimize this would be to use an indexed array like this it does the job but i guess there s somewhere a better and or faster way of doing this alot easier and smarter maybe even without preg replace due to the early morning and or the lack of good coffee i was unable to find it myself so far any suggestions 
ocs r why have multiple pools so i m running ocs r enterprise we currently have one pool with one server in it when we brought out a consultant he was emphatic that we needed a director server so we brought it up but didn t have time to fully intigrate it to the envrioment he left and now that i have time to research the stuff i think i he s wrong my understanding is that a director routes between multiple pools so if a user logs in and is on pool a he ll go to pool a and not pool b to scale a pool incase of performance issues a hardware loadbalancer is required which is what we were concerned about so if my above understanding is correct why have multiple pools is there somewhere that cleanly explains this thanks

user defined thumnails for django project i m putting together a web site that makes heavy use of images those images need to be thumbnailed at various sizes to fit different templates i m aware of solutions like sorl thumbnail which seems perfect in every way except one i need to be able to override automatic resizing and cropping if the computer s choice is a bad one for instance say i upload a by pixel image i need a by thumbnail of that image the sorl thumbnail solution if i understand it right is to rescale the image to by and then lop off the top and the bottom what i want to be able to do is a accept the sorl style solution if it works for the image but b be able to override the sorl choice in the admin probably if that would work better if it s a picture of a person for example maybe i would rather crop out the person s torso and just make a thumbnail out of her face which happens to be located in the upper right corner there s no off the shelf pluggable solution for this so far as i can tell but please correct me if i m wrong barring that i d like to hear your ideas about ways that the problem might be approached is there some sort of jquery plugin that will get me halfway there help

python and ruby frameworks equivalent to codeignter i am a decent php programmer i had been learning python for some time due to the django hype but now i find that i don t like django that much reason being it does a bit too much by itself i prefer frameworks like codeigniter as they let me focus on writing php instead of learning about the framework its small so when i encounter a problem i can debug it relatively easily there is no cli tool not that i don t like them i personally think php is too simple for them no automatic code generation etc no magic at all i can plug in stuff like doctrine easily and remove it too if it messes up things but the thing is i have started liking python much more than php i keep coding stuff in it to automate some day to day tasks and from what i have read about ruby its as interesting as python are their frameworks in python and ruby which offer as much freedom as codeigniter or is their some way i can use django and rails in the same way i e using a basic skeleton most of the time and adding only the things i need as i write this question i can see that this can be done easily in django by adding removing various imports please tell me if its correct however i d love to hear about other lightweight magic less frameworks and also if rails can be made into one the way django can be update by magic i mean a framework which necessarily does things which i find hard to understand and hence cannot customize easily also codeigniter s philosophy of not tying you to any strict coding standards is what i love i love the freedom and ease of use i like seperating the mvc s as i have seen its use but codeigniter allows overriding this behavior if required very easily also i just started making a facebook app in django my very first django app after tuts and books with only the sessions app installed and am reading the docs thoroughly before importing anything necessary loving it

selectively disabling keyboard accelerators i have an mfc windows program that has a list control as the main interface when the user right clicks in the list a context menu is displayed but some of the commands are context sensitive e g only apply when items are selected etc so i perform a check and disable any that don t apply this is simple enough but the program also has some accelerators that perform some of the same commands and i cannot figure out how to selectively disable accelerators i considered putting a separate check in each and every individual handler but that is a management and performance to a degree nightmare especially when compared to how i can toggle the context menu items in a single location the right click handler for example if ctrl c copies the currently selected item s and ctrl i inserts a new item then how can i disable ctrl c when no items are selected and leave ctrl i alone in the case of this specific program it is a dialog application so to get accelerators to work i am using the trick

terminology wanted adjoint bialgebra i m trying to figure out what is the correct terminology for the following concept in p a bialgebra b is said to be self adjoint if it comes with a nondegenerate bilinear form relative to which the multiplication and comultiplication are adjoint to one another ie lt mult x otimes y z gt lt x otimes y comult z gt and also the unit and counit are adjoint which i assume means lt unit k x gt lt k counit x gt later on in the book they define a bilinear form nsym times qsym rightarrow mathbb k in order to show that nsym the hopf algebra of non commutative symmetric functions and qsym the hopf algebra of quasi symmetric functions are dual to one another my question is really about what is the relationship between adjointness and duality in this case does self adjoint mean something different from self dual would it be valid to say that nsym and qsym are mutually adjoint i can see that the existence of the bilinear form between nsym and qsym shows that nsym is isomorphic to the dual of qsym and vice versa is it possible for bialgebras a and b to be mutually adjoint one way round but not the other ie the multiplication of one is adjoint to the comultiplication of the other but not vice versa hazewinkel et al lie algebras and hopf algebras

using google docs avoiding multiple calls to importxml google spreadsheet i have a google spreadsheet that i m using to monitor several youtube videos for each video i am using importxml to grab the following data from individual youtube video pages title views keywords to be clear i have no problem using importxml in this way this approach is working perfectly the problem is that each one of these individual pieces of data uses it s own importxml call this limits me to videos since google places a reasonable limitation of calls per sheet datum videos calls less than the maximum what i think i d like to do is make one call per video grab the entire html stuff it into a hidden cell and parse that cell for the data that d permit me to grab videos which has much more appeal obviously i ve got the plan but no idea if i could parse a cell using xpath that way the documentation i ve seen doesn t appear to permit using xpath that way but it seems so obvious has anyone done this or am i barking up the wrong tree

gettings list of files usmt will capture i would like to make a list of all the files that usmt will capture the purpose for this is that i d like to provide that list to a user before their migration to win which details which files will be backed up i want them to be able to review it before actually wiping their system i first tried the genmigxml switch which uses the document finder it does work in finding files it would backup but it provides no means that i know of to configure it i cannot provide it the migapp xml or the migdocs xml files to add or remove the list of files that it is capturing it simply captures the same list of files and takes no additional switches i then tried the genconfig switch which generates a config xml file it takes multiple input xmls and spits out another xml but the resulting xml file doesn t actually have files and folders listed for example it only states that it will backup firefox but doesn t state which files and folders are apart of that the only other option i could think of is to actually use usmt to migrate data locally and use the listfiles switch to get a list of the files that are being backed up that seems like a terrible way to handle this i would like another option to address this

in cocoatouch iphone os how do i find eliminate leaks that the instruments leak tool doesn t find i have an iphone app that is running great in the simulator it responds well to the memory warnings by getting rid of everything that is not absolutely essential when i run it on the device it runs well but after a certain amount of usage it crashes with error code which from what i can tell is the os killing it due to memory usage i can see the memory warning i m logging it and my app responds to it but dies shortly thereafter if i look at the app in instruments either on the device or in sim it doesn t find any leaks in addition the net memory usage is in the range of k bytes transitioning from the different views of my app increases memory usage as expected but when the views and controllers are released and dealloc d the memory usage never quite goes as low as it was however the addition is usually only something in the range of bytes so while leaks shows me no leaks i suspect there is an issue somewhere i ve also looked at all of the objects i m allocating and all of them seem to be reclaimed as expected the only objects i see that keep increasing are generalblock n where n is some number should i not pay any attention to instruments net usage figure what would be the next steps in trying to diagnose the issue added i m not making any calls to malloc or any corefoundation libraries that would return a buffer that i m responsible for the only non obj c calls i m making are logging statements to nslog

best method using teamcity for stopping and restarting services on remote hosts ok i can t fully decide if this is better asked on serverfault or so but i think this is more of a programming question at heart you may disagree i m trying to wrap up all sorts of deployment activities into a single console application then execute it with appropriate parameters with the teamcity build command line runner however attempting to stop start install windows services on a remote machine seems to be a tricky business using servicecontroller from a process that can t run with elevated permissions at this point it might actually be the easiest method to execute powershell scripts using invoke command on each remote host of course allowing this is a different security hole than disabling uac or other options would anyone care to venture an opinion of what methodology would be the best way to proceed

cisco asa user authentication options openid public rsa sig others my organization has a cisco asa which i have made act as a firewall gateway for one of our offices most resources a remote user would come looking for exist inside i ve implemented the usual deal basic inside networks with outbound nat one primary outside interface with some secondary public ips in the pat pool for public facing services a couple site to site ipsec links to other branches etc and i m working now on vpn i have the webvpn clientless ssl vpn working and even traversing the site to site links at the moment i m leaving a legacy openvpn as in place for thick client vpn what i would like to do is standardize on an authentication method for all vpn then switch to the cisco s ipsec thick vpn server i m trying to figure out what s really possible for authentication for these vpn users thick client and clientless my organization uses google apps and we already use dotnetopenauth to authenticate users for a couple internal services i d like to be able to do the same thing for thin and thick vpn alternatively a signature based solution using rsa public keypairs ssh keygen type would be useful to identify user hardware i m trying to get away from legacy username password auth especially if it s internal to the cisco just another password set to manage and for users to forget i know i can map against an existing ldap server but we have ldap accounts created for only about of the user base mostly developers for linux shell access i guess what i m looking for is a piece of middleware which appears to the cisco as an ldap server but will interface with the user s existing openid identity nothing i ve seen in the cisco suggests it can do this natively but rsa public keys would be a runner up and much much better than standalone or even ldap auth what s really practical here

the correct way to call unmanaged code from partially trusted code what is the correct way to call unmanaged code such as a com api through net interop from a code that is being executed in a partially trusted environment while developing an asp net webpart for microsoft sharepoint i had to communicate with another system through its com api i solved this issue temporarily by changing sharepoint s permissions to full later i refined this by implementing custom security on top of the minimal settings which gives sharepoint unmanagedcode permission but this isn t that big of an improvement as unmanaged code can skip the rest of the cas from what i have gathered i probably need a fully trusted assembly which allows partially trusted callers and acts as a layer between the managed and unmanaged domains also i d imagine there is a need for some extra settings which allow the partially trusted code call fully trusted code without the fully trusted code suffering from the permissions of the partially trusted code so what is the correct way and how to implement it in practice

use smart quotes in dynamic text field in flash cs i have a flash movie that has a text field where the user can enter their desired text it has a counterpart text field that displays the user entered text nearby there s also a dropdown menu where the user can change the font in the display area fonts are included in the library this all works fine we noticed though that one of the fonts english vivace bt has smart curly quotes available but as the user types they always get straight quotes instead of curly ones the straight quotes clearly do not match the font is there a way to tell flash to use smart quotes as the default rather than straight ones i know users can manually force it to use curly quotes by using alt for example but i don t expect them to know that and even if they do it shouldn t be required i m thinking i might be able to catch all quotes and encode them myself behind the scenes in as so if they enter a single quote i replace it with the curly quote but that sounds like a pita i m hoping there s a setting somewhere instead it seems like other adobe programs do have a setting for typographic quotes but i can t find that option in flash

how to detemine the type of actual object without using typeid rtti i have a class hiearchy in which child classes derive from parents at one place i need to store queue objects of any type into a list list parent and later retrieve objects from that list when storing i store pointers which points to the top most parent class when retrieving i need to understand which child object it is actually to be able to correctly use it by down casting the straightforward method may be to use dynamic cast and check if it returns or not but i know if i am not wrong that would mean using rtti how would you achieve this without using rtti inserting a mtype field in the parent class and letting any child class to assign a specific type info for this field and then check its value to see what is the type whenever needed but this seems to be a cumbersome method doesn t it any help is greatly appreciated regards

null vs empty when dealing with user input yes another null vs empty string question i agree with the idea that null means not set while empty string means a value that is empty here s my problem if the default value for a column is null how do i allow the user to enter that null let s say a new user is created on a system there is a first and last name field last name is required while first name is not when creating the user the person will see text inputs one for first and one for last the person chooses to only enter the last name the first name is technically not set during the insert i check the length of each field setting all fields that are empty to null when looking at the database i see that the first name is not set the question that immediately comes to mind is that maybe they never saw the first name field ie because of an error but this is not the case they left if blank so my question is how do you decide when a field should be set to null or an empty string when receiving user input how do you know that the user wants the field to be not set without detecting focus or if they deleted a value or or related question http stackoverflow com questions null or empty string to represent no data in table column

shared variables and dll usage questions in visual basic scope confusion i m trying to split some prior crafted code into a dll it s a simple logger system there are a few things that need to be shared with the main form in the project so i set them up as a shared variable but i don t use shared stuff often and i worry it will cause variable conflicts regarding scope i figured i would make a post here about it and see if someone can explain what i don t fully understand since this is a logger it will be used a couple of places other dlls that need logging may reference it through a instanced object and project reference my main form will also have an instanced object and a reference to the logger libary since one of my properties is a connection string and it s shared does this mean that a instance of my logger class inside a dll will have the same shared values as a instance on my main ui form or will the fact that the instance is inside of a dll provide the scope boundary i need i m hoping it does i mainly worry that i might want to log using two different connection strings down the road i hope my question makes sense if it doesn t post comments and i ll try to clarify

handle a database crash in the application level question is pretty clear and ill set an example read this lets say we have an application in the user s machine and a remote database the application is highly dependent on the database to retrieve stuff according to user s selections which are the approaches to handle a database crash internet disconnection etc one would be to show a message when an attempt to connect to the db occurs but then what shut down the application or is it possible to disable it for lets say one minute and retry connecting during this period and if it fails then force shut it down again

stdout redirection to a file does not work if groovy script run directly from command line groovy in pathext i ve updated the title please see update below for the reason i have asked this question on stackoverflow but still didn t receive an answer groovy redirect stdout to a file does not work i ve decided to ask here since i think it s may be not a programming issue but rather some problem with groovy installation version conflict etc here are some details i wrote a very simple script to output a string to stdout with system out println it works unless i want to redirect the output to a file interestingly the file is created but it s empty i also tried a simple hello world script with java same jdk and it works well someone confirmed in comments that my groovy script does redirect properly on windows and os x the groovy installation was fresh with the latest version i followed all the installation instructions i tried to run some existing scripts and everything works except this redirection i have no clue where to look now please help update ok i ve just tried one more thing that come to mind i have extension associated with groovy executable so i can run a script without typing so i did and it was not working now i ve tried and it works so the question is now simpler why redirection does not work if i don t use in the command line please also recommend what i should do with this question delete the so version update here is the related registry record hkcr groovy shell open command 
java portals and portlets the java world has a jsr standard for how portals and portlets should interoperate software components sharing a unified web page there seem to be a number of portal implementations but is there a live marketplace of interchangeable portlets that will run in them from what i can find searching the web it looks very lopsided all portals and no portlets it s like if there were dozens of android phones and no apps if a product were to base itself on jsr or some implementation thereof what s the likelihood of a corporate customer having a bunch of portlets that it might want to add to the portal it strikes me that most corporates will already have a portal like page based on their choice of erp or crm product that their business runs on or maybe even just ms outlook s today page so if i ship a new product intended for corporate customers and i make it a portal rather than a set of portlets what is the likelihood of my customers abandoning their existing ibm sap oracle portal and using my portal as their new homepage i m guessing not great and if i make it a set of jsr compliant portlets are my customers going to have a way to host host portlets i m guessing also not great finally jsr seems quite mute about html javascript i e how portals and portlets would interoperate inside the browser it s all about java based server side stuff defining a way to cooperate in the use of urls so that each full page refresh can be routed to the correct portlet it doesn t seem to acknowledge the modern rich ajax approach it mentions ajax only in passing this blog post and the comments under it have provided a lot of food for thought and seem to confirm my suspicions professional hands on experience along with the above research led me to the conclusion that the portal architecture lacks enough technical advantages and distinguishing features to warrant an increase in acceptance in practice few applications can constrain themselves to the isolated and disparate functionality of portlets and relinquishing this degree of architectural control is unrealistic in enterprise level software the portal architecture s window of opportunity to become a mainstream technology has not only closed but closed quite some time ago so to summarise this as a more coherent question what actual value would i get by building on jsr at this point

asp net mvc data validation does this carry from a domainmodel to a viewmodel given my understanding of mvc and ddd critique as necessary domain models can be created by factories and persisted by repositories these are poco objects view models contain partial or complete domain models as needed by the view they are generated by a service that interacts with a repository thus domain models never make it to the view directly likewise viewmodels are never persisted you will very likely have multiple view models for the same domain model because you could show it on multiple views that said adding data validation to the domain model removes any kind of redundancy so how do you get the viewmodels to inherit the domain model data validation i wouldn t expect simply referencing a domain model from a view model to work

adding editing deleting existing code using an install script in php i have wanted to create a pbbg creator primarily text based games however i couldn t think of a system that efficiently allowed people to have the base code then install modules into the game adding new features for example the base code would consist of a simple home page and bare bones admin panel then you would install a registration module which would add new code and new database tables and a login module that would use the registration module s tables then from there you could install a stats module adding health mana etc that would add more columns in the database for users this would go on till you had a fully operating game made up of several different modules made by several different people what i want to know is if this idea is a good one what are some issues that might appear and how would i go about making it easy to add edit and delete code like if a combat module had a module that modified the combat system how would i go about determining what to change from an install script also are there any other open source projects using this system i can study to grasp the idea better i hope i explained everything well enough if not please let me know so i can correct that thanks

asp net cache total entries vs output cache entries vs private bytes the background is i have couple websites using asp net v and running on a iis server with bit but recently i have one site randomly slow down so i have to do recycle to make it back to normal after i checked the graph captured by performance monitor i have couple questions related to the asp net cache total entries counter from the description of microsoft cache total entries include use of the cache by the asp net page framework and use of the application cache through cache apis but in the asp net v counters i can only find the cache api entries and output cache entires and their sums is not equable to cache total entries at a specific time so my questions are where are the rest entries coming from in the cache total entries for certain days records the cache total entries keeps increasing while output cache entries and cache api entries stays flat the cache total entries value might decrease a little bit such as for a while due to cache total trims or output cache trims occurred but in the long run it still keeps increasing however comparing to other days records the cache total entries would decrease a lot such as without cache total trims nor api output cache trims happened i only set up the expiration policy for output cache entries and didn t touch the rest cache entries so another two questions i can t understand how the cache total entries works and why it decrease that much without any trim or expire policy setup even though i setup mins expire policy for output cache and output cache entries does decrease but it decrease way longer than mins i think it should have more frequently decrease in the graph i understand the output cache turnover rate is more frequently such as seconds due to new entries add in but combine them together i can t figure out the pattern of output cache wont decrease in a very long period i know i have a very long description i really can t find any relations between all the entries and how they can affect the private memory for a specify process please let me know if you guys have any thoughts thanks

proving two expressions can never be simultaneously satisfied i have a very simple problem the technique of which i want to apply to more difficult problems here is the simple example version suppose we have four functions f x sin x g x and f x cos x g x i want to show that there does not exist an x in mathbb r for which f x g x and f x g x simultaneously i proceed like this for a contradiction suppose there exists an x in mathbb r such that f x g x and f x g x then multiplying the first expression by sin x and the second by cos x gives sin x and cos x now add the two above expressions to obtain sin x cos x from which we conclude that since this is absurd then we have shown that no such x in mathbb r exists and our proof is complete i want to be able to apply this method to more complicated functions f i neq and g i neq my question is this is the above technique correct for the simple example and what general tools might i use to solve such problems simultaneous equations spring to mind for linear f and g for example

overriding mappings for a map of basic types i m working on a jpa compliancy kit for my internship part of that kit is testing corner cases jsr states on page that the annotation may be applied to an element collection containing instances of an embeddable class or to a map collection whose key and or value is an embeddable class how then do i according to jpa override the mapping of a map of basic types i know i can use mapkeycolumn to map the key of the map and i m sure there is some way to map the value side of the collectiontable as well but how would i go about overriding these consider an embeddable with a map how would i go about overriding the key and the value do i use attributeoverride or something else or is it impossible i m assuming here that such a map would be mapped with a collectiontable so please correct me if i m wrong if jpa doesn t give an answer i d be interested in knowing how persistence providers have solved this problem edit viruzzo commented that basic types are embeddable types i m willing to accept that but something is holding me back jsr is referring to an embeddable class see upper quote type and class are not the same 
is it possible to have setediting yes and display uitableviewcell accessories at the same time i have a uitableview that is set in edit mode in the viewdidload as so i also have the method return no because i don t want the indentation effect now on some of my cells i display the plus sign by using the method what i would also like to do is display various cell accessory types such as the detaildisclosurebutton i however cannot get this to work while the tableview is in editing mode i think it only works when setediting is set to no example doing this on some tableviewcells does not make the button appear however if i change the editing mode to no it works but i loose the signs from the editingstyleforrowatindexpath method how can i get both to work at the same time note i never will have both a sign and a accessorybutton on the same cell so if i could turn off editing at the cell level and not the tableview level that would solve the problem is this possible any other alternatives ps i m using xcode w arc amp storyboards

how do i fake dropped packets or actually make them fail background one of our clients suffers from an intermittant problem with their internet where it will drop packets when a user downloads a large file their it is looking into the problem i have an application consisting of a web server running windows r iis and a client running windows chrome which uses a long running xmlhttprequest to transfer messages from the server to the client the problem my application should be should be fairly immune to these packet losses but in practice it isn t i want to test the application under various different network problem scenarios eg random packet loss and bursty packet loss say complete loss of packets for ms and so on i m looking for a solution which lets me reproduce a scenario and test my application i could use g or unplug and unplug the network cable but the effects are not very reproduceable the question is there an application driver which i can install on my machine to mimick dodgy internet connections or perhaps an appliance or proxy server i can use in the network to mock these scenarios i m guessing it s not very easy to do on a modern computer because i expect most of the tcp stack is offloaded to the network card but i would have thought this was a reasonably popular thing to try and do however i haven t had any luck on google i m more proficient on windows but a solution which uses linux either as a client or proxy would be welcome

how to scale fix locations of imagebuttons to imageview for multi displays support i am using a scrollview to hold and display a static map image which is px x px in size and is implemented so that i can scroll up and down to view the map i have implemented so that the scrollview should fit and fill the screen the static map is a patch image with only the right edge allowed to stretch on the static map i have overlaid map pins at specific locations using imagebuttons that are defined programatically i have noticed that if i test with a specific avd hvga for instance and have all the map pins located at the exact locations once i switch the same emulator to a different resolution wvga for instance all the pins will be off thw way i define the location of each map pin is that i first experiment with each individual imagebutton view with the emulator at hvga so that i know the proper dpi values that will produce the perfect location in the emulator the imagebuttons are then created and placed dynamically in java which requires pixel unit and i have use proper dpi to pixel conversion code to be sure that the correct pixel unit can be calculated based on the screen density the placement of the map pin is based on the setmargin call by moving the pin x pixels from the left edge and y pixels down from the top edge not sure if this is the proper way to define location of an imagebutton but i thought the dpi to pixel conversion will take care of the transformation here is my xml and here is the relevant portion of the java code any idea how i can get this to work thanks in advance

how can i load a function just once and store the return in a variable i m currently going over my user registration code the part i m focusing on right now is the password hashing part what i do is get a static salt from a config file and use mt rand to generate a dynamic salt what i want to do is have this dynamic salt stored in my database but if i pass the dynamic salt method to the create method in order to send it to the salt column of a table in my database it will just run the method again and create a different result from the one produced in my hashed method what would be the best way to achieve what i m trying to achieve could you show me an example if possible 
efficient decoding of binary and text structures packets background there is a well known tool called wireshark i ve been using it for ages it is great but performance is the problem common usage scenario includes several data preparation steps in order to extract a data subset to be analyzed later without that step it takes minutes to do filtering with big traces wireshark is next to unusable the actual idea is to create a better solution fast parallel and efficient to be used as a data aggregator storage requirements the actual requirement is to use all power provided by modern hardware i should say there is a room for different types of optimization and i hope i did a good job on upper layers but technology is the main question right now according to the current design there are several flavors of packet decoders dissectors interactive decoders decoding logic can be easily changed in runtime such approach can be quite useful for protocol developers decoding speed is not that critical but flexibility and fast results are more important embeddable decoders can be used as a library this type is supposed to have good performance and be flexible enough to use all available cpus and cores decoders as a service can be accessed through a clean api this type should provide best of the breed performance and efficiency results my current solution is jvm based decoders the actual idea is to reuse the code eliminate porting etc but still have good efficiency interactive decoders implemented on groovy embeddable decoders implemented on java decoders as a service tomcat optimizations embeddable decoders wrapped into a servlet binary in xml out problems to be solved groovy provides way to much power and everything but lucks expressiveness in this particular case decoding protocol into a tree structure is a dead end too many resources are simply wasted memory consumption is somewhat hard to control i did several optimizations but still not happy with profiling results tomcat with various bells and whistles still introduces to much overhead mainly connection handling am i doing right using jvm everywhere do you see any other good and elegant way to achieve the initial goal get easy to write highly scalable and efficient protocol decoders the protocol format of the results etc are not fixed 
implement a string to string database just like but all data should be stored on disk instead of in memory as i understand it two parts should be done indexing and storage i ve learned some data structures about indexing like linear hash or b tree and writing an on disk int int database is not too hard the problem is storage for integers all records are in same size once we get position to record by indexing we can extract modify or lazy delete easily but for strings records are in flexible size it should have at least the following problems put a longer string we cannot simply overwrite the old record we dave to do del and put and the space for old record is wasted del the space for old record is wasted too and cannot be used again maybe we can collect deleted space with a garbage collector but it costs extra space and makes fragment for int int database wasting spaces for several integers is not a big problem but a string is longer it costs more wasted spaces i need some advice hints for solving the problems

sell me on ioc containers please i ve seen several recommend use of ioc containers in code the motivation is simple take the following dependency injected code into the above is hypothetical c example of course while i agree that this simplifies the interface of the class by removing the dependency constructor parameter i think the cure is worse than the disease for a couple of reasons first and this is a big one for me this makes your program dependent on an external configuration file if you need single binary deployment you simply cannot use these kinds of containers the second issue is that the api is now weakly and worse stringly typed the evidence in this hypothetical example is the string argument to the ioc container and the cast on the result so are there other benefits of using these kinds of containers or do i just disagree with those recommending the containers

is there special way to manage an always growing database disclaimer i am newbie in database world i wonder how do you solve the problem of an always growing table i mean suppose i would like to know the last added item then i do select from planethistory where name earth order by date desc limit that seems to be a bad idea because it would take more and more time as table grows what come to my mind is to prepare the design of database for the usual future queries for this example the database could include a table with a single field and a instance that would store the last added so before doing the insert i should read that field increment it by one and then write it it sound weird but it seems worse for me to order terabyte of data just to know which is the last that s weirder

explain what is a linear transformation my textbook says unique linear transformations can be defined by a few values if the given domain vectors form a basis however that is all it says so can someone explain what a unique linear transformation is to help make this question more manageable let me give you some examples from the text t x and t x this is a unique linear b c a b x b a x will equal do some foiling ax b for all a b real q mmm so what about a b x b a x will equal do some foiling ax b for all a b real tells me this is a unique linear transformation even more fundamentally just looking at the example problem it seems we have transformations so if we were going to look for a unique transformation shouldn t we only look at t x and or t x individually or if we wanted to look at them both should we be asking if a new unlisted transformation t which is t x x is a unique linear transformation perhaps i m just not really clear on what exactly we are finding the linear transformation of t x t x not unique because t a b ax b works but so does t a b bx a b q again what specifically are we finding the linear transformation of where does ax b and bx a b comes from how did the author arrive at it i m just not sure on how to interpret these equations that s it yes i know my questions were probably confused for i am but i m looking for anything to help give me clarity for i have nothing more to go on that the sentences from the book unique linear transformations can be defined by a few values if the given domain vectors form a basis otherwise it could fail the uniqueness condition or worse yet fail the definition of a function thanks in advance

ubuntu how to scan and reinstall lost files from installed packages recently my ubuntu server had a disk failure after a livecd amp fsck ext it seems many inodes are lost most of them should be program files of installed apt packages before i m going to reinstall the whole system i need to reboot the server and run some server applications to backup some data amp configurations and sure enough i couldn t boot the server again because some files are lost i think something like apt cache might remember those program files installed from deb packages i want it scan over the disk and found out which program files are missing and then refetch them from the ubuntu repository this may just look like the windows utility which just re copy all incorrect versioned system files from the cdrom but i m not sure if aptitude support this kind of recovery 
when should i use jquery s document ready function i was told to use document ready when i first started to use javascript jquery but i never really learned why might someone provide some basic guidelines on when it makes sense to wrap javascript jquery code inside jquery s some topics i m interested in jquery s method i use the method for ajax quite a bit typically on dynamically created dom elements should the click handlers always be inside performance is it more performant to keep various javascript jquery objects inside or outside document ready also is the performance difference significant object scope ajax loaded pages can t access objects that were inside the prior page s document ready correct they can only access objects which were outside document ready i e truly global objects update to follow a best practice all my javascript the jquery library and my app s code is at the bottom of my html page and i m using the attribute on the jquery containing scripts on my ajax loaded pages so that i can access the jquery library on these pages

invalid adts sampling frequency index and channel configuration why i hope someone can direct me on the right path before i put a lot of time and effort on this i m currently trying to parse an aac frame to get information such as number of channels and sample frequency so it seems that we can simply get this information from the adts header but most of the time this information is inaccurate so the question is why is this data inaccurate what is the meaning of the adts header channel and sample freq should i rely on it should i parse further down the frame to get this information fyi the aac raw data is coming from streaming servers thanks for the help moto 
method for aligning nodes of different sizes at specified sections i m trying to make a tikz diagram in which i can place nodes with long pieces of text one above the other such that i can specify sections which are to be centered things outside these sections are then dragged along with a vertical arrow connecting the centers of the centered sections that s kind of a jumble of words so to give an example i d like something like this to automatically produce this so that the center of is at and the center of is at the main things i m looking for in a solution are that i want to avoid any manual adjustment of distances or sizes i want everything to appear on the same baseline for example i tried making nodes for upper and lower left middle and right and when one of them had a descender and the others did not it looked off perhaps there s a way around this apologies for not having more to offer but i m simply stuck on this of course the hypothetical code i used above is just an idea if you see another way of setting up a solution as i m sure there are many please post it as well

criteria for swapping integration and summation order i have a function a potential from an electrostatic potential via a fourier series in the form of v x y z sum n sum m a x n m b y n c z m int int f u v d u n e v m du dv here functions a b c d e are known well behaved mostly fourier terms so smooth sines or expoentials f is unknown i can certainly safely move all of the terms into the integral v x y z sum n sum m int int a x n m b y n c z m f u v d u n e v m du dv this form is not yet useful to me i want to switch it around to be in the form v x y z int int f u v w u v du dv where all the summations get combined into a weight function w u v with all the summation nastiness hidden inside my final goal is to evaluate this weight function numerically i m sure this is possible it s a method that s used to compute greens functions in various applications but in my derivation steps i get to the step where the summation and integration sum sum int int must be swapped to int int sum sum and i can t figure out when this is legal and when it isn t it s a trick that many derivations simply seem to leave as given they just say we swap the order in papers like this and lectures like this or i find dense theory not practice about convergence in complex poles with finite cuts and bruises fubini the great s magic trick supermeasuringtape theory yadda yadda including here so i understand there s a wealth of fancy theoretical math on this question and i understand that some lazy physicists just swap the order and don t even try to justify it i am hoping someone can give me some intermediate balance between these extremes something which says when the swap is justified and when it s not assuming really smooth constantly differentiable terms like i have in my first equation above is the swap always safe for my example above for any smooth functions a b c d and e thanks

php typecasting an int as a string doesn t seem to work as expected i am trying to calculate percentiles for users in a database in order to do this i have a array that i need to sort i have a query object that contains and here s how the code looks so far what i believe that should do is typecast an int as a string then the index should be set as a string right when i sort the array using it sorts it as though the index was an integer rather than a string this means it loses the index the php manual for states associative string keys will be maintained but numeric keys will be re indexed i have also tried using but the same output occurs however it does work when i do but this doesn t quite feel like the right solution to me can anyone help thanks in advance

asp net mvc beta defaultmodelbinder wrongly persists parameter and validation state between unrelated requests when i use the default model binding to bind form parameters to a complex object which is a parameter to an action the framework remembers the values passed to the first request meaning that any subsequent request to that action gets the same data as the first the parameter values and validation state are persisted between unrelated web requests here is my controller code represents access to the back end of the app my aspx view strongly typed as contains directives like this uses the class which is meant to autobind my model s properties i hit the page enter valid data e g time the app correctly saves the new object with time i then hit it again enter different valid data e g time however the data that gets saved is the original e g time this also affects validation so if my original data was invalid then all data i enter in the future is considered invalid restarting iis or rebuilding my code flushes the persisted state i can fix the problem by writing my own hard coded model binder a basic naive example of which is shown below am i missing something i don t think it s a browser session problem as i can reproduce the problem if the first data is entered in one browser and the second in another

regexp to filter a table ok well i have a table that gets outputted by some open source software but it does not get outputted in an actual table format eg instead the people that developed the software decided that it would be a good a idea to output the table like so so i cant build a web scraper to get the data or well im not shure if i could build a scraper to scrape that since its all wrapped inside one tag so instead i have been trying to use ruby and regex to try and get the job done so far i have managed to get all the leading s out and also i have managed to get the heading but only that far since it seems that i have to repeat the pattern the whole time it doesnt want to repeat itself ok but enough talking for now here is the code i have used so far and for example the output for the first line would only be it has be in csv format so il use to replace the remaining s with s i can use php or ruby so any answer is more than welcome

uniform distribution from a fractal perlin noise function in c my perlin noise function which adds up octaves of d simplex at persistence generates a d array array of s these numbers each come out normalized to with mean at i clamp them to avoid exceptions which i think are due to floating point accuracy issues but i am fairly sure my scaling factor is good enough for restricting the noise output to exactly this neighborhood in the ideal case anyway that s all details the point is here is a by array of noise the histogram with a normal fit looks like this matlab s is a function which applies the lilliefors test to determine if a set of numbers comes from a normal distribution my result was repeatedly which means that these numbers are not normally distributed i would like a function such that when applied to the list of values from my noise function the results appear uniformly distributed i would like this function to be implementable in c and not take minutes to run once again it shouldn t matter where the numbers come from the question is about transforming one distribution into another specifically a normal like one to uniform nevertheless my noise function implementation is based on this and this you can find the above array of values here

can i set the sslinsecurerenegotiation directive with setenvif we re running apache with openssl one of our citrix netscaler hosts cannot send a client certificate after handshaking ssl as we have to set sslinsecurerenegotiation off as a security standard is there anyway to dynamically set this directive based on remote addr i have tried so many settings but as designed i guess there doesn t seem to be a way of selectively allowing sslinsecurerenegotiation for one user agent or ip we ve already patched to latest netscaler but after the ssl initial handshake a renegotiation request is sent back from apache to the netscaler because as a client cert is required for a locationmatch this is never responded to leading apache to terminate session http tools ietf org html rfc section we re told by citrix that downstream rules are normally on a trusted network and not supported using the client method is it possible to differentiate between requests and how the sslinsecurerenegotiation directive is called by host identity of some sort or ip some comments from other forum i don t believe it can be set anywhere lower than virtual server level which is why i m thinking it needs to be addressed at the load balancer despite what citrix might say they seem to have quite a few different values that tls renegotiation that can be set including disabling renegotiation support between client and server altogether maybe posting this question over on serverfault will help mahnsc hours ago hi problem is more that ssl offload is designed to operate in front of web servers not clients end but unfortunately our project went ahead regardless citrix have not fully implemented rfc extension to prevent man in the middle attacks out the backend as they consider the backend behind the netscaler logical in this reversed context a trusted channel with a rd party hosting apache with the strict security rules for all traffic i could probably convince them to set a special case for our host but can t find a way of setting the directive in session ev nsj mins ago

windows server one mac address assign multiple external ip s to virtualboxes running as guests on host couldn t find any help google or here the scenario windows server std x on i gb ram the server is running in a data centre one hardware nic realtek pcie gbe one mac address the data centre provides us static external ip s the first is assigned to the host by default of course i have ordered all ip s the data centre can assign the available ip s to the physical mac address of the given nic only this means one nic one mac address ip s everything works fine so far now what i would like to have installed virtualbox with guests running each gets it s own external ip assigned each of it should be an standalone win server it looks like the easiest way would be to put the guests into an virtual subnet and routing all data coming to the nd till th external ip through to this guests using there subnet ip s i have been through the virtualbox user manuel regarding networking what s not working i can t use bridged networking without anything else because the ip s are assigned to the one mac address only i can t use nat networking because it does not allow access from outside or the host to the guest i do not wanna use port forwarding host only networking itself would not allow internet access by sharing the default internet connection of the host internet is granted from the guest to the outside but not from outside or the host to the guest internalnetworking is not really an option here what i have tried is to create an additional ms loopback adapter for a routed subnet where the vbox guests are in now the idea was to nat the internet connection to the loopback subnet but i can t ping the gateway from the guests by using route command in the command shell or rras static route nat i didn t get there as well solutions like the following do work for the one way but not for the way back for your situation it might be best to use the host only adapter for ics go to the preferences of vb itself and select network there you can change the configuration for the interface set the ip address to netmask disable the dhcp server if it isn t already and that s it now the guest should get an ip from windows itself and be able to get onto the internet while you can also access the host slowly i m pretty stucked with this topic there is a possibility i ve just overlooked something or just didn t getting it by trying especially using rras but it s kinda hard to find useful howto s or something in the web thanks in advance best regards simon

pygtk system tray icon app runs two instances and closes both when user quits only one good evening i m writing a simple system tray app for linux that checks for system updates using python and gtk so far i have the basic functionality the app runs displays an icon and by right clicking there is a menu with a few more options the problem comes about when i try to change the gtk statusicon to a different image rather than swapping the original icon for the alert icon it creates a second icon in the tray so now the standard icon and the alert icon are side by side and when quitting the alert icon instance of the app closes both this particular app is in two parts code below the back end script that runs within an hourly cron job and the gui system tray icon which can be run as auto started and or via the applications menu i have read through the pygtk documentation but nothing that i saw explains how to switch swap the icons in place i m sure that i am missing something and would appreciate any constructive input from a second pair of eyes here s the back end code and here is the gui code for the systray app thanks again in advance

managing deployment depencies in java i am trying to figure out what is the best way to handle dependencies in app servers we are considering maven to build the apps but we found a problem it appears when we need to update a proprietary shared library that doesn t have version number this happens once a month and we are using websphere shared library function in the following way for each shared library in websphere we create an alias without version for example db component receives the alias db component during the first deployment we associate the app with the required libraries using the aliases as we ignore the version all apps must use the same version creating some restrictions but when we need to upgrade a shared library we just upload the new library in ws and then all apps uses the updated version we have more than apps that rely on proprietary shared libraries these libraries change constantly and this solution makes the management easier but it seems a bit odd that the dependencies are changed outside the application s build process the dependency control isn t reliable anymore because the info in app s pom may be false in addition all apps must use the same versions i think that a better solution may exist we ve considered another model include the dependencies in every war this allows us to use different versions of libraries in each application without restriction but there is one problem when a change is made in a proprietary shared library we need to rebuild and redeploy all apps i have thought about our proprietary shared library being so instable or using a solution that mixes both ideas but i am not sure how to solve this problem osgi looks like a better way to handle dependencies but we would have the same problem upgrading many apps should we use ws s shared library function is there a better way to solve this problem tips are highly appreciated thanks

what is a simple and secure way to transmit a login key from one website to another while redirecting a user i want to create a portal website for log in news and user management and another web site for a web app that the portal redirects to after login one of my goals is to be able to host the portal and web app on different servers the portal would transmit the user s id to the web app once the user had successfully logged in and been redirected to the web app but i don t want people to be able to just bypass the login or access other users accounts by transmitting user ids straight to the web app my first thought is to transmit the user id encrypted as a post variable or query string value using some kind of public private key scenario and adding a datetime stamp to key to make it vary everytime but i haven t done this kind of thing before so i m wondering if there aren t better ways to do this i could potentially communicate via database by having the portal store the user id with a key in a database and passing that key to the web app which uses it to get the user id from that database but that seems crazy can anyone give a way to do this or advice or is this a bad idea all together thanks for your time 
is it possible to avoiding copies of data when using memory mapped files in c my understanding of how memory mapped files work in c is that every request for data results in a copy for instance if you had a large data structure persisted as a file using a memory mapped file would result in memory for the actual file mapped into ram and a copy residing in a gc heap once it was read from the file i m assuming this is because pointers and the gc don t get along well together generally speaking so is there any way around this perhaps via some mixed mode c that can expose a managed api over the memory mapped data what about direct pointer manipulation with unsafe c the general problem i m trying to solve is sharing a large data structure between multiple processes the data structure is used to answer a small set of questions that can be exposed as a simple api i e basically a highly specialized index of a bunch of other data on a side note doesn t this make the net api useless for the sharing large amounts of data scenario

how can i parse a string into a hash using keywords in perl i have a string where different predefined keywords introduce different data is there a way to do that using clever use of regexp or something here is an example keywords can be and now i want to parse into of course the order of the keywords in the input string is not fixed this should also work on i understand there are issues to be raised with spaces and so on i ll ignore them here i know how to solve this problem looping on the different keywords but i don t find that very pretty split almost fits the bill its only problem is that it returns an array and not a hash so i don t know which is the first name or the last name my example is somewhat misleading here is another one will print 
php using facebook oauth with less api calls my goal is to use facebook login on a website with as few api calls as possible i don t want to use any server sided facebook api call on sites that don t interact with facebook at all that means i only want to use api calls for logging in and publishing things however i don t want to use facebooks permission flag here are some thoughts use own sessions for the site instead of relying on facebook sessions so a user stays logged in even if the facebook session token is expired otherwise the user will be logged out as soon as the token is expired and needs to click login again to get a new token or facebooks js sdk will auto login but this still isn t perfect because the user will see the page in logged out state and it will refresh as soon as the js sdk got a new token no js users have to click the login button again cache facebook user data in database or memcache use facebook api subscription to keep the database updated no need to ask the api for changes in the user s facebook profile problem while using own sessions the facebook session token might be expired when trying to publish sth on facebook so you have to abort the current script and get a new token by redirecting the user to facebook or using the js sdk then continue the script this is pain my thought on how to solve the problem instead of publishing things on facebook using php you can also do this in javascript if the token is expired just get a new one using js which does not require the page to be reloaded nor the page to be redirected to facebook however i want to support users with disabled javascript and then this is not possible in my opinion the only useful approach is to use own sessions with cached user data and keep the people logged in even if the facebook token is expired but redirect them to facebook and back as soon as facebook interaction is required this way the user won t see the page in logged out state no javascript is required and the user will be only redirected to facebook login if it s really needed for javascript users the facebook js sdk will renew the token which is then stored in a cookie without the user noticing this as the user is still logged in using the own session handling what do you think is there another better approach to do this my last point quite seems doable but isn t there an easier way thanks

how many vertices in multi dimensional space all i have is a mathbb r n space and a number of restrictions which look like this sum i n a i x i ge a quad a i in mathbb r i would like to have a concept of vertices within my subspace and an ability to count them mathbb r case since restrictions are geometrically half planes i can draw lines on paper and see what happens the simplest closed figure is a triangle it has vertices and needs a minimum of restrictions to exist now every additional restriction can add no more than additional vertice this is obvious in dimensional space this means that for k ge restrictions there can exist no more than k vertices mathbb r case similarly the simplest closed figure appears to be a triangular pyramid it has vertices and needs a minimum of restrictions to exist i cannot visualize anything simpler than that now it gets a little more complicated with additional restrictions but i m taking a guess that for k ge restrictions there can exist no more than k vertices as you can see i need a strict formalization in order to even tackle this question for higher dimensions what would you suggest also i m pretty sure that there was a bunch of mathematicians who contemplated this before me so simple references would also be appreciated

how to understand the todd class i am reading the article k theory and elliptic operators http arxiv org abs math which is about atiyah singer index theorem in page the article discussed the thom isomorphism psi h k x rightarrow h n k c e and phi k x rightarrow k e with psi x rightarrow pi x lambda e and phi x rightarrow pi x cup mu greg further defined a correction factor mu e such that psi mu e cup operatorname ch x operatorname ch phi x he analyzed mu e by splitting principle and give the expression mu e cup e e mathbb r operatorname ch left sum n i i wedge i e right operatorname ch left prod n i l i right prod n i e x i he argued that since e e mathbb r c n e prod x i we can conclude mu e prod n i frac e x i x i he then define the todd class operatorname td e prod n i frac x i e x i such that we have mu e n operatorname td overline e my questions are is the step from mu e cup e e mathbb r to mu e justified i feel uncertain about this as i have only seen it somewhere in milnor amp stasheff s appendix i do not know if this is the cap product or some other operation normally cup product made h c e to be a ring instead of a field i think i need to clarify details in here why we define the todd class in terms of the relationship operatorname td e prod n i frac x i e x i instead of just using the result for mu e is there any deeper motivation for it on the other hand why cannot we simply define mu e by the relation mu e cup psi operatorname ch x operatorname ch phi x i am not sure what the calculation of this will be but i feel it should be easier than the calculation in previous definition i did take a look at the wikipedia article and found the two definitions are mostly the same i think maybe with time i can understand todd class better it is not mentioned in the book characteristic classes at least the part i covered so i feel i do not really understand it i hope i can understand it enough to understand the atiyah singer index theorem

create and clean db setup only once for testing all daos does anybody knows a way to achieve the following flow for testing daos run sql script to create common db setup insert data into all tables test dao test dao clean up db data created in step using spring hibernate junit maven stack i understand that best practice would be that we create data for each test dao beforeclass and clean up the same after all tests are done afterclass but in our case there are just too many dependencies between different database tables client s legacy db can t do anything about that at the moment populating each table with test data requires data in many other tables as well so creating data individually for each dao would be very tough and time consuming so we really need to create db test data only once i ve created test data using static block in basedao extended by each dao test class which obviously runs only once but problem how to clean up the same when all tests of all dao test subclasses get completed an afterclass teardown method in base class will run each time after a dao test class completes please advise

convert large switch to hash or other recommendation i currently have an android application that displays a schedule for a ferry boat the application can display the full schedule just a giant list but the selling point in the application is it will display when the next two ferries are departing and how long from the current time that departure is i am relatively new to java and currently use large switch statements in my code basically it gets the current phone time and compares it to all of the times in the schedule at which point it displays the next two departure times and then calculates the difference between current time and the departure times i am sure that a switch statement is not the best idea for speed purposes as well as code changing purposes for example if one time changes its a bunch of lines of code to go in and fix for that one time change also if the entire schedule changes everyone has to update their app for the time change to take effect my ideal situation would be to store a file somewhere on my webserver that could be downloaded and inserted into a hashmap i think is the correct term that would load the new schedule if there was a time change not sure how confusing this is but it would be greatly appreciated if someone could explain how i might use a hashmap or something else you might recommend to get this task accomplished currently the variables are the two ferry terminals as well as the day of the week since the schedule changes per day monday tues friday saturday sunday below is a screenshot of the application so you can understand it if my post wasn t clear thank you in advance screenshot

how to configure bind for a private subdomain i am attempting to define a subdomain for a private network rfc behind a nat firewall let s call it priv example com normally and from what i can gather on various websites this could be done by delegating the subdomain from the public and external dns server for example com to another dns server that is internal and authoritative for priv example com i have a couple problems to overcome with this solution however the first is that i don t need or want the public internet to be aware of priv example com i suppose this could be handled with bind views but i haven t quite figured this out yet nor am i sure whether our dns host supports views the second is that i would have to open a hole in the firewall and create an address translation so the external dns server can see the internal one this seems like an unnecessary security risk is there a way to create this scenario without making the public dns server for example com aware of the private dns for priv example com i am using bind for the internal private server is there a better overall solution to provide name service for my private network i ve seen other more controversial solutions such as using a private tld or defining a duplicate master dns for the second level domain within the private network these seem like ugly hacks to me

module or inheritance i have an inventory and a warehouse model there is also a user and owneditem model an owneditem is polymorphic to inventory and warehouse so that a warehouse or inventory can have an owned item for a certain user now a warehouse and an inventory have certain similarities for instance they handle the slots in a pretty similar manner to illustrate this is an inventory function i created this one returns the empty slots number of the inventory this function would be almost the same for the warehouse identical expect from the inventory part so now i m wondering if a module applies here though a module may be ok it does not feel too natural if i were doing that in c i would definately use inheritance i would probably have another class maybe named something like slotmanager that would handle this and my inventory class would inherit that and use it but ruby does not support multiple inheritance only mixins don t really know much about it so i would like to ask what would be a good approach of course i m willing to study new things

unpredictable memory explosions the main server at my company has recently been having a lot of downtime for reasons that neither i nor the other admins can determine it has random very sudden explosions in memory it becomes unresponsive because it exhausts all the memory and then we have to reboot it very annoying it s a debian system we haven t upgraded to squeeze or anything it s been perfectly stable for a long time the problem is that the logs are totally useless they don t seem to indicate that anything is going wrong i m guessing that some process is buggy and hogging all of the memory but i have no way of proving that at the moment remote logging is no help because it s not complaining about anything it thinks everything is peachy so my question is how would you approach this problem any insight is appreciated thanks

tips on speeding up jdbc writes i am writing a program that does a lot of writes to a postgres database in a typical scenario i would be writing say rows to a table that s well normalized three foreign integer keys the combination of which is the primary key and the index of the table i am using preparedstatements and executebatch yet i can only manage to push in say k rows in about seconds on my laptop when the embedded database we re replacing which has the same foreign key constraints and indices does it in i am new at jdbc and i don t expect it to beat a custom embedded db but i was hoping it to be only x slower not x anything obvious that i maybe missing does the order of the writes matter i e say if it s not the order of the index things to look at to squeeze out a bit more speed

 vary if none match to cache mobile and desktop requests seperately note please correct me if any of my assumptions are wrong i m not very sure of any of this i have been playing around with http caching on heroku and trying to work out a nice way to differentiate between mobile and desktop requests when caching using varnish on heroku my first idea was that i could set a header so the cache is varied on as rails automatically sends back etags generated from a hash of the content the etag would vary between desktop and mobile requests different templates and so it would eventually cache two versions not fact just my original thoughts i have been playing around with this but i don t think it works firstly i can t wrap my head around when if anything gets cached as surely requests with will be conditional gets anyway secondly in practice fresh requests ones without if none match sometimes receive the mobile site is this because the cache doesn t know whether to serve up the mobile or desktop cached version as the header isn t there as it probably sounds i am rather confused will this approach work in any way or am i being silly also is there anyway to achieve separate cached versions if i am unable to reach the varnish config at all as i am on heroku the exact code i am using in rails to set the cache headers is edit i am aware i can use but trying to avoid it if possible due to it have a high miss rate many many user agents

absolute import failing in subpackage that shadows a stdlib package name basically i have a subpackage with the same name as a standard library package logging and i d like it to be able to absolute import the standard one no matter how i run it but this fails when i m in the parent package it really looks like either a bug or an undocumented behaviour of the new absolute import support new as of python tried with and package layout in we import our own logging subpackage in we want to import the stdlib package note the folder containing is in sys path when imported from outside above the output is as expected so the absolute import in the subpackage finds the stdlib package as desired but when we re inside the folder it behaves differently the double output for sub name shows that my own subpackage called logging is importing itself a second time and it does not find the stdlib logging package even though absolute import is enabled the use case is that i d like to be able to work with test etc this package regardless of what the current directory is changing the name from logging to something else would be a workaround but not a desirable one and in any case this behaviour doesn t seem to fit with the description of how absolute imports should work any ideas what is going on whether this is a bug mine or python s or whether this behaviour is in fact implied by some documentation edit the answer by gahooa shows clearly what the problem is a crude work around that proves that s it is shown here

on morphisms on varieties and projective implies iso for my thesis i have to learn about double covers of surfaces all varieties in this question are projective over mathbb c if necessary let phi v rightarrow w be a double cover of surfaces by definition a surjective map finite of degree with ramification locus cup e i on w where the curves e i are disjoint and their sum is a divisor divisible by two of course now using that phi is projective hence universally closed i can show that the preimage of an e i is a curve f i that is irreducible as well hence phi f i f i rightarrow e i is a finite map of degree between irreducible projective curves now my question is how do we show that phi f i is an isomorphism i am giving the background because i expect that in general finite surjective projective maps need not be isomorphisms when answering could you say something about this as well it would be really nice if it holds but the assumptions seem so weak thanks in advance joachim edit in fact i do need to show that phi f i is finite of degree one can someone help me out here i am working on the general case now and i think i showed that a finite surjective projective map gives an open cover with isomorphic opens of both varieties can we use projectiveness to immediately conclude isomorphism of projective varieties i m sorry i made a bit of a mess of this question should have given it some more thought before posting it since people might have read it already i think its better to keep it in the current order p s i think i m neglecting the proper use of preimage scheme theoretically which i think should include the double ramification in the structure sheaf but i m happy to take it the naive way any comments on this are appreciated but not necessary

why can t i have protected interface members what is the argument against declaring protected access members on interfaces this for example is invalid in this example the interface would guarantee that implementors at least provide an instance to their inheritors if the implementor wanted to they could expand the scope to full the intent of members on interfaces is to provide a support contract for inheritors sub classes for example admittedly this wouldn t work for s i can t see much of a case for or modifiers in interfaces but supporting both and modifiers seems perfectly reasonable i m going to try explaining the utility of members on s by separating them from s entirely let s imagine a new c keyword to enforce inheritor contracts so that we declare things as follows this would allows us to contract classes to provide protected members to their inheritors this is not particularly useful because classes would already imply this contract by providing the members in the first place but then we could also do this thereby applying to all classes which implement and requiring them to provide particular members which is not something we can currently do

custom mime type for php file okay so i have a weird one for you all today i m looking into creating a custom mime type for a php file i ve read some pro s con s on this and it won t be for much other than some experimentation to see what can really be done my company s initials are ttp and so we decided it d be kinda fun to have all of our php pages re written to a custom ttp extension i ve attempted my normal cpanel x route with adding it in and i ve also tried adding the change into the htaccess file it work s perfectly fine until i change the application type to anything php some things that have come up was an issue that doing this renders the php file and therefore makes it difficult for the browser to decide how to handle it any other ideas i m pretty sure that at the end of the day this won t be something the company will do but they wanted to see if any experiment i could run will work

java problem in deploying web application i have built a java web application and packed it in a file and tested it on my local tomcat server and it is running fine but when i deployed it on my client s server it is showing an error according to the remote server my client s server it is not finding a file packed in a jar file which i had placed in directory but when i checked the directory for the jar file i found that it was there the contents of is as follows i think that there is no need to explicitly mention the classpath of directory as it is in the classpath of any web application by default then why the server can t find the jar file in the directory when i deployed it on a remote server and why it is working when i deployed the same application on my local server i posted a question for this at http stackoverflow com questions struts struts taglib jar is not being found by my web application but found that the problem is unusual as nobody could answer it so my questions are as follows q is still remains on the classpath if i leave the classpath entry blank as shown above in the manifest mf file or i should delete the classpath entry completely from the file or i should explicitly enter as the classpath entry q i have pages s and some helper classes in the web application jsp pages are located at the root servlets and helper classes are located in folder so is there any problem if my helper classes are located in the folder note please note that this question is not same as my previous question it is a follow up question of my previous question both the servers local and remote are tomcat servers

opencv matchtemplate gives inconsistent results between computers i m running the following code on two different computers the first one has a nvidia gpu quadro fx m and the second is quadro fx m compiled in vs opencv bit opencv was compiled from source the code i m running is the following there are two major things that puzzles me on the quadro fx m this function does not work the gpu output image imgc gpu is all zeros doesn t matter if input type u or f or correlation method ccor ccoef etc on the other hand in the quadro fx m i get consistent results between the cpu and gpu how can it be and what do i need to do to make it work on the quadro fx m in template matching every pixel in the output image can be calculated independently from the other pixels hence paralleling is easy and gpu implementation suits perfectly how is it possible that even when looking at the average time as in the code the gpu performance are times slower than the cpu it was verified on both computer with no other process running in the background ohad

best practices for securing api credentials as part of an iphone app the apps that i build frequently have social media service requirements e g twitter bit ly facebook for most of these services i need to have an api key of some sort i m trying to work out the best way of including these api keys in the application binary the desired level of security depends on the possible attacks that can be conducted by malicious attackers twitter i have an xauth enabled key and secret both need to be used by the iphone app fallout from attack malicious users could post twitter status updates masquerading as coming from my app there is no twitter account to hijack and start posting status updates on bit ly i have a username password and api key to login to the website and access analytics the username and password are required to create links via the api only the username and api key are required by my iphone apps the password will not be in the app in any form fallout from attack malicious users could create links on my bit ly account they would need to do a separate attack to brute force or otherwise gain the password to login to the account for both of those services the potential for harm doesn t seem too great but for other services it could be much worse i can just define the api credentials as strings in the header or in line in the code but then it s vulnerable to someone using strings on the application to see what s in it i could then start doing silly concatenation xor ing in the code to recreate the api key in memory and the attacker would have to do a bit more work to recover any keys in the binary my concern with that is that i m not a cryptographer and would create an embarrassingly weak form of obfuscation there what better suggestions do people have

calculating subnets i have just set up my first home lan and i want to start playing around with some basic networking concepts specifically i would like to create two subnets now although i want these subnets to be meaninful and to serve a real function i want them more so as to get practice setting up my first subnets since i m really new to networking the only use i can think of for subnets on a home lan might be to have a range of public ip addresses that can be reached from outside my private home lan and a range of ips that would be private internal intranet i was thinking that if i gave my network a netmask of that it would split all available ip s into groups a public range in between and a private range between have my assumptions thus far been correct if not please correct me and steer me in the right direction perhaps my netmask is wrong

best way to manage share permissions with centos inside windows domain i have successfully installed centos and joined it to a windows active directory domain with winbind and samba we are moving one of our file servers over to centos one of the things i am having trouble figuring out is assigning permissions to file shares in case you are curious as to how i set this up i followed this tutorial http www linuxmail info active directory integration samba centos to give an example say we have a share called shared which we want the domain users group to be able to access and write to now say we have a folder inside of that share called secret we only want the secret agents group to be able to read and write to that folder it should become clear that restricting access to a subfolder of a samba share is either impossible or difficult to set up which is what got me into looking at using posix acls my first question is is this a good way to go about setting this up your first thought may be to break the secret folder out onto its own share but since in real life we have lots and lots of subfolders inside shares with different sets of permissions giving each differing folder its own share would become a nightmare my second question is if using posix acl s is a good way then would the acl s be left intact if files and folders were backed up and restored would they also be left intact if say the server blows up and we restored those files and folders to another server i don t know a whole lot about posix acl s i just learned about them today so if there are any potential problems or catches that you think i should know about please include those too thanks for your time

applying how activerecord uses modules to other ruby projects i decided to dig into the activerecord code for rails to try and figure out how some of it works and was surprised to see it comprised of many modules which all seem to get included into activerecord base i know ruby modules provide a means of grouping related and reusable methods that can be mixed into other classes to extend their functionality however most of the activerecord modules seem highly specific to activerecord there seems to be references to instance variables in some modules suggesting the modules are aware of the internals of the overall activerecord class and other modules this got me wondering about how activerecord is designed and how this logic could or should be applied to other ruby applications it is a common design pattern to split large classes into modules that are not really reusable elsewhere simply to split up the class file is it seen as good or bad design when modules make use of instance variables that are perhaps defined by a different module or part of the class in cases where a class can have many methods and it would become cumbersome to have them all defined in one file would it make as much sense to simply reopen the class in other files and define more methods in there in a command line application i am working on i have a few classes that do various functions but i have a top level class that provides an api for the overall application what i found is that class is becoming bogged down with a lot of methods that really hand off work to other class and is like the glues that holds the pieces of the application together i guess i am wondering if it would make sense for me to split out some of the related methods into modules or re open the class in different code files or is there something else i am not thinking of 
rails paperclip is not recognized by the identify command i am getting an error when trying to save a to a model with a paperclip attachment my model example of trying to set an icon example model error there are a number of people who have posted similar questions to this one especially this one but none of those solutions work for me my command path is set correctly in this still might be the problem though when trying to use identify directly i get the following error any suggestions as to what is going on here i have tried reinstalling imagemagick others have recommended adding it is definitely not a requirement for using paperclip and it also did not help another solution that has been suggested is removing the property that isn t a solution though i need to do the processing on the images i have paperclip working on another model in my project that handles documents that are not images don t do any processing so i know that it is probably related to that any other suggestions on how to address this problem 
sysprep on an already deployed system i ve done some digging on the site and around and i haven t seen anything that quite addresses my problem i have recently deployed a wsus sp hierarchy to a new data center and a pair of remote sites approximately half of the machines almost entirely win in one of the sites are reporting into wsus but are showing no update status that is the unique machine name is there but no additional details impacted machines have this error in their windowsupdate log warning wu client failed searching for update with error x d my research has lead me to belief the issue is related to duplicated computer sids in one of the locations it appears that a machine that was cloned was not properly sysprep d prior to being imaged i now have about thirty machines reporting the same sid as determined by psgetsid in addition to rebuilding the clone image i now have to resolve this issue on the thirty client machines i am afraid they may have to be rebuilt i am aware that ms strongly states that sysprep is to be run on non deployed machines can i run sysprep on an already deployed machine and what are the ramifications is there another solution the resolves this issue short of a complete rebuild

mysql columns point vs x decimal lat lng performance i m creating a new data model for a project which will quickly contain many rows in this regard i am considering if i should use mysql or to store lat lng position indications i know that not choosing will make it harder for me to make geo calculations since i don t get the new built in geo functions available for fields but i can live without them since geo selects will be only with a outer box model like i am however worried about database size and more importantly query time performace is point a fixed length field like decimal will it be more efficient to use point or x decimal for lat lng

ftp put fails from virtual machine but not host pc command not implemented for that parameter i have an ftp script i m using to automate a file transfer the transfer works fine on my pc xp sp but when i try and run it on a vm on my pc xp sp the put commands gives off ftp file the ftp site server is around the world and not under my control from what i understand of a that means the command should never work but since the same script does work on my pc hosting the vm that eliminates syntax file naming etc the put command when triggered from the vm actually creates a length file on the target ftp server but doesn t populate the file 
does unbalanced load on three phase ups use more power and cost more we have a three phase online data center ups someone said recently that if the input amperage across the phases were we d pay for the kwh represented by amps but if the same load were spread out to we d pay for kwh corresponding to only amps really i can believe that balancing the load across phases puts less stress on the ups but does it also reduce the power bill so dramatically

ways for mapping a directed acyclic graph to a grid matrix i have a dag with many thousands of vertexes and edges i m looking for algorithms that can position the vertexes on grid points in a way that s the most human friendly aesthetic my hunch is that the nicest layout would be similar to the layout with minimum sum of edge lengths can you point me to efficient algorithms for such minimum sum of edge lengths layouts or to other algorithms that could help me tackle this problem here s part of the output from a very naive algorithm 
setting and displaying event time to the client at different time zones i was wondering what is the best way to deal with time zones let s say wrote a message to now is at and is at and let s say server sets time in so how would i deal with all this difference in time zones i am writing jquery plugin which is going to update time how long ago something happened my best guess is to set server to and then just calculate time difference based on client time zone but is there a way to get client time zone or maybe im doing it in a wrong way 
can i make the powershell error object behave consistently in both script and interactive mode i m writing a powershell script that uses to detect and respond to errors my problem is that i get different behavior for the object depending on how i run the script if i run it interactively specifically from powershell ise then errors get added to the collection but if i run the same script from the command line the same errors occur but are not added to the collection here s the script pared down to illustrate the issue when i run this from powershell ise it behaves as expected sqlcmd raises a non terminating error which is caught and handled here s the output but when i run it from the command line as i would if i were to set up a scheduled task nothing gets added to and no exceptions are raised here s the output i also get the same results if i run the script file from the powershell command line rather than cmd exe which makes sense for example i suspect this has something to do with the execution context or maybe something about parser modes that i m still not quite grokking or maybe even my profile although so far i ve been running everything from the same pc under the same account i ve seen a lot of examples online that use this basic approach of with so it seems like i should be able to make this work so my question is essentially can i make this script work like i think it should and if not what am i misunderstanding how do i catch these sorts of errors if it helps i don t need super detailed exception handling for this one i just need to know when something goes wrong so that my task monitor can alert me a non zero return code from powershell exe would be sufficient i m looking into the use and but i m betting will have the same issue as and both only apply to the last statement executed which is less than ideal since my real script is quite a bit longer than this example edit ok i ve since learned that windows executables such as sqlcmd never add anything to the collection even if they return a non zero exit code is only used by cmdlets if i understand correctly i got my script working through the repeated use of although i could have used as well because it recognizes windows executable exit codes and gets set to false for non zero values to sum up the behavior of the script when run from the command line is the correct expected behavior still don t know why i got different results from the powershell ise though 
opengl texure coordinates issue apologies for the vague title i couldn t think how to phrase it i m having an issue with texture mapping in opengl i m attempting to apply different textures to different objects in the scene but i m finding that applying a second texture to a second object is changing the texture coordinates i think on the first one the two objects are a cube and a cylinder with only one texture enabled the scene looks like this if i then enable textures for or more other objects i see this i m not too bothered about the bad texture mapping on the wheels right now what could be causing this my drawing code for the cube and cylinders is below cube cylinder

add customer id to order when placed retrieve it in customer index i m trying to create an ordering system so that when an order is placed the customer logs in registers and the order is added to their index i have two controllers and all their respective models views etc called orders and customers i m assuming i d need to add a method so that the customer id is added to the order when it is placed and then i could display all orders with that id in that particular customer s index i e they can only see their own orders it s probably quite a simple question apologies but i m new to rails and can t figure out how to get started on this one please can someone suggest how i would go about doing this edit thanks for everyone s help how would i get the customer index to display only orders for that customer would i store the customer id in a session when they log in then place that in the order then find all orders with that id in the index page i think i know how to get their id into a session at login but am unsure how to extract this into the customer index view any help would be much appreciated 
why shouldn t data be modified on an http get request i know that using non get methods post put delete to modify server data is the right way to do things i can find multiple resources claiming that get requests should not change resources on the server however if a client were to come up to me today and say i don t care what the right way to do things is it s easier for us to use your api if we can just use call urls and get some xml back we don t want to have to build http requests and post put xml what business conducive reasons could i give to convince them otherwise are there caching implications security issues i m kind of looking for more than just it doesn t make sense semantically or it makes things ambiguous edit thanks for the answers so far regarding prefetching i m not as concerned with prefetching since is mostly surrounding internal network api use and not visitable html pages that would have links that could be prefetched by a browser 
has anyone studied this particular sequence i m going to tag this as reference request since i m mainly interested in finding out whether this kind of sequence has been named in literature before just in order to acknowledge it for something i am working on the sequence is the following a n prod n p i p i for n geq where p i is the i th prime number so it s basically the sequence of integers of prime factors to the power of themselves i e and so on do you know is this has been studied if yes could you recommend any interesting literature on it
